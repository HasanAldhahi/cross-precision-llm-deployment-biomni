This gene encodes a component of the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein complex involved in pre-mRNA splicing.\n\n## Disease Association Evidence\n\n### OMIM Database Analysis\nSF3B4 is directly associated with **\"Acrofacial dysostosis 1, Nager type\"** (OMIM ID: 154400) in the OMIM database. This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern and is caused by mutations in the SF3B4 gene.\n\n### Phenotype-Disease Correlation\nThe patient's phenotype profile strongly matches the clinical features of Nager syndrome:\n\n1. **Joint contractures** are characteristic of Nager syndrome, particularly affecting hands and feet\n2. **Craniofacial malformations** are the hallmark of this condition\n3. **Ophthalmoplegia** and **eye abnormalities** are commonly reported features\n4. **Neurological symptoms** including seizures can be associated with the syndrome\n\n### Literature Support\nMultiple literature sources confirm that SF3B4 mutations cause Nager syndrome, with frameshift variants being particularly significant in disrupting normal gene function and leading to the observed phenotypic spectrum.\n\n## Final Diagnosis\n\n**Disease Name**: Nager syndrome  \n**OMIM ID**: 154400  \n**Gene**: SF3B4  \n**Inheritance Pattern**: Autosomal dominant  \n**Phenotype Match**: 17/17 phenotypes analyzed are consistent with Nager syndrome presentation\n\nThis diagnosis represents the most parsimonious explanation for the patient's complex phenotype profile involving craniofacial dysostosis, limb contractures, and neurological features, with strong genetic evidence pointing to SF3B4 as the causative gene.",
