This condition is characterized by:\n\n- Congenital cardiac defects including atrial and ventricular septal abnormalities\n- Multiple associated congenital anomalies\n- Autosomal dominant inheritance pattern\n- Causative gene: ACTC1\n\nThe patient's phenotype profile matches the known clinical spectrum of atrial septal defect 5, particularly the combination of cardiac defects with other developmental abnormalities.\n\n## Final Diagnosis\n\n```json\n{\"disease_name\": \"Atrial septal defect 5\", \"OMIM_ID\": \"612794\"}\n```",
