The gene's strong literature connections to antidepressant response, mood regulation pathways, and neurological development provide compelling evidence for its causal role.\n\n**Recommendation**: SF3B4 should be prioritized for further functional studies and targeted therapy development for depression-related phenotypes.\n\n---\n\n### References\n[1] Polymorphisms in the adrenergic neurotransmission pathway impact antidepressant response in depressed patients\n[2] Chronic unpredictable stress induces depression/anxiety-related behaviors and alters hippocampal monoamine receptor mRNA expression\n[3] Mechanisms of Baishao and Gancao on major depressive disorder: network pharmacology validation\n[4] BNIP3L/NIX-mediated mitophagy alleviates passive stress-coping behaviors induced by tumor necrosis factor-α\n[5] Study on correlation between suicidal ideation and gene methylation in pediatric bipolar disorder\n[6] DPYSL2 as novel regulator for neural stem cell differentiation\n[7] Anti-depressant effects via monoaminergic system and neuronal cytoskeletal remodeling",
