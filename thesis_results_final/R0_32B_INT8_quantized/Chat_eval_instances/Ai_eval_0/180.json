Mutations cause:\n- Intestinal hypoperistalsis leading to bowel dysfunction\n- Visceral muscle weakness affecting multiple organ systems\n- Secondary manifestations across cardiovascular, hepatic, and respiratory systems\n\n### Comparative Analysis\nACTG2 provides the most comprehensive explanation for the patient's phenotype pattern compared to other candidates, which typically cause more isolated or different types of disorders.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**Causal Gene: ENSG00000163017 (ACTG2)**\n\nThe analysis strongly supports ACTG2 as the causal gene based on its association with megacystis-microcolon-intestinal hypoperistalsis syndrome and visceral myopathy, which directly explain the patient's core gastrointestinal and muscular phenotypes. The gene's known function and associated syndrome pattern provide the best explanation for the observed multi-system involvement.\n\n---\n\n*Report generated through systematic analysis of OMIM gene-disease associations and comprehensive phenotype matching.*",
