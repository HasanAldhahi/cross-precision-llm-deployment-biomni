This protein directly regulates uric acid reabsorption from glomerular filtrate, making it a critical determinant of serum uric acid levels [4].\n\n## Biological Mechanism\n\nGout is caused by hyperuricemia leading to uric acid crystal deposition. URAT1 (encoded by SLC22A12) controls the reabsorption of uric acid in the kidney, determining the net excretion of uric acid from the body. Variants in SLC22A12 affect transporter efficiency, directly influencing uric acid serum levels and gout susceptibility.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**SLC22A12** is the most likely causal gene for gout in this locus based on:\n- Strongest statistical associations (50 GWAS hits)\n- Direct biological relevance as the primary urate transporter\n- Consistent literature support across multiple populations\n- Clear mechanistic pathway linking gene function to disease\n\n---\n\n**References:**\n[1] Association studies showing SLC22A12 variants explain GWAS signals for serum uric acid  \n[2] Literature confirming SLC22A12 encodes URAT1, the kidney urate transporter  \n[3] Multiple population studies linking SLC22A12 to hyperuricemia and gout  \n[4] Functional studies demonstrating URAT1's role in uric acid reabsorption",
