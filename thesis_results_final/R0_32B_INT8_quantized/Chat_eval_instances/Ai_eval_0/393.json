This phenotype represents a composite score capturing sexual dimorphism across multiple cardiometabolic traits, including those that show sex-specific differences in expression and disease risk [1].\n\n## Methodology\n\n1. **GWAS Catalog Query**: Searched for existing associations with \"Multi-trait sum score\" and related cardiometabolic phenotypes\n2. **Literature Review**: Conducted systematic PubMed searches for each gene in the locus in relation to cardiometabolic traits and sexual dimorphism\n3. **Functional Analysis**: Evaluated biological mechanisms and pathways for genes showing potential relevance\n\n## Key Findings\n\n### Primary Candidate: SCMH1\n\n**SCMH1 (Sex comb on midleg homolog 1)** emerged as the strongest candidate based on the following evidence:\n\n- **Direct Sexual Dimorphism**: The gene name literally contains \"Sex comb,\" referencing a sexually dimorphic structure\n- **Chromatin Regulation**: Functions as a Polycomb protein that mediates exclusion of Polycomb complexes from the XY body in pachytene spermatocytes [2]\n- **Gene Regulation Mechanism**: As a chromatin remodeling factor, it directly regulates sex-specific gene expression patterns\n- **Biological Plausibility**: The mechanism of action aligns perfectly with the concept of \"multi-trait sex scores\" that capture sexual dimorphism across multiple phenotypes\n\n### Secondary Candidates\n\n**ZFP69B**: Showed some relevance to body composition and obesity-related traits in epigenome-wide studies, but lacks direct mechanistic connection to sexual dimorphism.\n\n**FOXO6**: Associated with polycystic ovary syndrome progression, indicating some sex-specific effects, but not directly related to sexual dimorphism in cardiometabolic traits.\n\n**KCNQ4**: Demonstrated sex-dependent effects on vascular reactivity, showing potential relevance to cardiometabolic traits but limited to specific pathways.\n\n### Other Genes\n\nThe remaining genes (CETP, BBS2, CCL17, CCL22, CIAPIN1, CPNE2, CX3CL1, HERPUD1, MT1A, MT1B, MT1E, MT1F, MT1G, MT1H, MT1M, MT1X, MT2A, MT3, MT4, NLRC5, NUDT21, NUP93, OGFOD1, PLLP, PSME3IP1, RSPRY1, SLC12A3) showed no clear associations with sexual dimorphism or multi-trait cardiometabolic scores in the literature.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**SCMH1** is the most likely causal gene for the Multi-trait sum score GWAS phenotype due to its direct involvement in sexual dimorphism through chromatin-mediated gene regulation. The gene's function in mediating sex-specific gene expression patterns provides a compelling biological mechanism for affecting multiple cardiometabolic traits differently in males and females.\n\n---\n\n**References:**\n[1] Vosberg DE et al.
