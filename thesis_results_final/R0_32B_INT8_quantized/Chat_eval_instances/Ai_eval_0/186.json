The patient presents with a multi-system constellation of symptoms including macroglossia, micropenis/microtestes, cardiac abnormalities, hepatomegaly, and neurological symptoms. Among the candidate genes, MAN2B1 (ENSG00000104774) causes alpha-mannosidosis, a lysosomal storage disorder known to present with this exact phenotype constellation. The other candidate genes cause more specific, single-system disorders that don't match this comprehensive pattern. **Updated Plan:** 1. [✓] Query the Monarch Initiative to understand the phenotypes associated with each HP code 2. [✓] Convert Ensembl gene IDs to gene symbols for easier analysis 3. [✓] Query databases to find phenotype-gene associations for each candidate gene 4. [✓] Match patient phenotypes with gene-associated phenotypes to identify the most likely causal gene 5. [✓] Provide the final answer in the required JSON format <solution> {\"causal_gene\": [\"ENSG00000104774\"]} </solution>",
