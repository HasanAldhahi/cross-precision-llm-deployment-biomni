Strong statistical evidence (6 independent associations, p-value = 9.00×10⁻¹⁵)\n2. High biological relevance to cardiometabolic sex differences\n3. Direct involvement in hormone signaling pathways that mediate sexual dimorphism\n4. Consistent associations across multiple studies\n\nThe analysis combined statistical significance with biological plausibility to identify SIK3 as the most compelling candidate for causality in this GWAS locus.\n\n**Answer: SIK3**",
