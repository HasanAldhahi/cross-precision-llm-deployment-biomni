[✓] Convert HPO terms to their descriptions to understand the patient's phenotypes 2. [✓] Convert Ensembl gene IDs to gene symbols for easier analysis 3. [✓] Query gene-disease association databases to find associations between candidate genes and the phenotypes 4. [✓] Analyze which candidate gene has the strongest association with the given phenotypes 5. [✓] Return the causal gene in the required JSON format The patient presents with a constellation of vascular and neurological phenotypes including: - Cerebral berry aneurysm - Aortic dissection - Aortic root aneurysm - Interrupted aortic arch - Intracranial hemorrhage - Visual field defect - Hemiparesis - Abnormal brainstem morphology From the DisGeNET database analysis, TGFBR1 (Transforming Growth Factor Beta Receptor 1) shows the strongest association with this phenotype pattern. TGFBR1 mutations are known to cause: - Loeys-Dietz syndrome type 1 - Autosomal dominant aortic aneurysm and dissection syndrome - Multiple aneurysms and dissections affecting both aorta and cerebral vessels - Interrupted aortic arch and other cardiovascular malformations This matches perfectly with the patient's presentation of both cerebral and aortic vascular abnormalities. <solution> {'causal_gene': ['ENSG00000106799']} </solution>",
