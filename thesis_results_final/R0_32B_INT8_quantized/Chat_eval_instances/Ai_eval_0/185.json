Mutations cause impaired excitatory neurotransmission leading to the observed neurological phenotype [3]\n\n4. **Exclusion of Alternatives**: Other candidates either lack direct association with the neurological core (APP, TACR3) or don't fully explain the complex phenotype pattern (FKRP, COPB2)\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**GRIN2B (ENSG00000273079)** is identified as the causal gene based on direct disease association with developmental and epileptic encephalopathy, comprehensive phenotype matching, and established molecular mechanisms.\n\n---\n\n**References:**\n[1] OMIM database entry for GRIN2B-associated developmental and epileptic encephalopathy 27 (OMIM: 616139)\n[2] Human Phenotype Ontology associations for GRIN2B gene variants\n[3] Molecular characterization of NMDA receptor dysfunction in GRIN2B-related disorders",
