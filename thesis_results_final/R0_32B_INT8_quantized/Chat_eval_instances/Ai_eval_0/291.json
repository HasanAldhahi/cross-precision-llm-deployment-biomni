G418V**.\n\n## Key Findings\n\n### Pathogenicity Classifications\nI searched ClinVar for each variant option and found the following pathogenicity classifications:\n\n**A. G418V** - Found in 3 different genes:\n- **F11**: Likely pathogenic ✓\n- KCNQ2: Likely benign\n- ARID1B: Likely benign\n\n**B. P335A** - Found in multiple genes:\n- Only \"Likely benign\" and \"Uncertain significance\" classifications ✗\n\n**C. Y755C** - Found in multiple genes:\n- Only \"Uncertain significance\" and \"Likely benign\" classifications ✗\n\n**D. P777R** - Found in multiple genes:\n- Only \"Likely benign\" and \"Uncertain significance\" classifications ✗\n\n### Evidence Assessment\n- **G418V** is the only variant with a \"Likely pathogenic\" classification in ClinVar\n- The other variants (P335A, Y755C, P777R) lack clear pathogenic classifications and primarily show benign or uncertain significance\n- G418V's pathogenic classification in the F11 gene specifically indicates its potential clinical significance\n\n## Conclusion\n**Answer: A. G418V**\n\nG418V is most likely to be pathogenic according to ClinVar, as it is the only variant among the options with a documented \"Likely pathogenic\" classification, while the others show primarily benign or uncertain significance classifications.",
