Among the candidate genes, **AP3B1** causes Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome 2, which would present with exactly this combination of phenotypes: - Visual problems from retinal hemorrhages - Cardiovascular abnormalities from bleeding complications - Sudden cardiac death from intracardiac bleeding - Growth abnormalities can also be part of the syndrome <solution> {'causal_gene': ['ENSG00000132842']} </solution>",
