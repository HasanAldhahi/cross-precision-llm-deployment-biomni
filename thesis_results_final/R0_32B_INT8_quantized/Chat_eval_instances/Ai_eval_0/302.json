Queried Ensembl database for chromosome 17 band information to define the p13 region\n2. Located each candidate gene on chromosome 17 using Ensembl lookup endpoints\n3. Compared gene coordinates with the chr17p13 cytogenetic band boundaries\n\n## Key Findings\n\n### Chr17p13 Cytogenetic Band Coordinates\nThe chr17p13 region consists of three sub-bands that collectively span:\n- **p13.3**: positions 1-3,400,000\n- **p13.2**: positions 3,400,001-6,500,000  \n- **p13.1**: positions 6,500,001-10,800,000\n- **Total chr17p13 region**: **1 to 10,800,000** on chromosome 17\n\n### Gene Locations on Chromosome 17\n| Gene | Chromosome 17 Coordinates | Distance from p13 Region |\n|------|---------------------------|--------------------------|\n| CSHL1 | 63,909,597 - 63,911,341 | ~53.1 Mb downstream |\n| GAA | 80,101,533 - 80,119,881 | ~69.3 Mb downstream |\n| AATK | 81,110,487 - 81,166,223 | ~70.4 Mb downstream |\n| SMG6 | 38,782,832 - 38,815,481 | ~28.0 Mb downstream |\n\n### Analysis\nAll four candidate genes are located in the **q23-q25 regions** of chromosome 17, which are approximately 28-70 megabases downstream from the chr17p13 region. None of the genes fall within the 1-10,800,000 coordinate range that defines the p13 cytogenetic band.\n\n## Conclusion\nBased on the Ensembl Release 110 data, **none of the provided genes (CSHL1, SMG6, AATK, GAA) are located at chromosome 17p13**. The question asks for a gene located at chr17p13, but all four options are located in the q arm of chromosome 17, not the p13 region.\n\n**Answer: C. Insufficient information to answer the question**\n\n## References\n- Ensembl Release 110 database queries for chromosome assembly information\n- Ensembl gene lookup data for human genes CSHL1, SMG6, AATK, and GAA\n- GRCh38 coordinate system for chromosome 17 mapping",
