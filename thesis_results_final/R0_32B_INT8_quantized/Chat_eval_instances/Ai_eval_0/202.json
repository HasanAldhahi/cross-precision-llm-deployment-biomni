Direct OMIM disease associations with GIST syndrome\n2. Extensive literature supporting PDGFRA mutations in sarcoma\n3. Clinical validation through targeted therapy responses\n4. Established role as primary driver gene rather than fusion partner or marker\n\n---\n\n### References\n[1] OMIM database entry for PDGFRA - Gastrointestinal stromal tumor/GIST-plus syndrome  \n[2] Multiple PubMed studies on PDGFRA-GIST associations  \n[3] DNA methylation profiling studies distinguishing GIST subtypes  \n[4] Clinical trials of imatinib and avapritinib in PDGFRA-mutated GISTs  \n[5] FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion studies in myeloid neoplasms  \n[6] Case reports of FIP1L1-PDGFRA rearrangements in sarcoma presentations  \n[7] Multi-omics analysis identifying CHIC2 as osteosarcoma survival marker  \n[8] Studies on CHIC2's role in tumor immunity mechanisms",
