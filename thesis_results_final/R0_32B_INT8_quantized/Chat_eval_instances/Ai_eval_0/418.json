Systematic examination of 67 genes in the locus for complement system relevance\n2. Query of GWAS catalog data for associations with complement component 4 protein concentration\n3. Literature review of complement system biology and gene functions\n4. Assessment of statistical significance and biological plausibility\n\n## Key Findings\n\n### Direct Protein Encoders\n**C4A** and **C4B** are the most biologically relevant candidates as they directly encode the complement component 4 protein:\n- C4A encodes the alpha chain of complement component 4\n- C4B encodes the beta chain of complement component 4\n- Both genes together form the complete C4 protein\n\n### GWAS Evidence\nMultiple genes from the locus showed significant associations with neonatal circulating C4 protein concentration:\n\n| Gene | Biological Function | P-value | Effect Size |\n|------|-------------------|---------|-------------|\n| **C4A** | Encodes complement component 4A | N/A | N/A |\n| **C4B** | Encodes complement component 4B | N/A | N/A |\n| TNXB | Extracellular matrix protein | 4e-217, 2e-157, 2e-15 | 0.41, 0.66, 0.16 |\n| STK19 | Serine/threonine kinase | 1e-261, 8e-140 | 0.63, 0.32 |\n| GPANK1 | GTPase-activating protein | 5e-93, 1e-300 | 0.13, 0.53 |\n| VARS1 | Valyl-tRNA synthetase | 8e-145 | 0.39 |\n| HSPA1A/HSPA1B | Heat shock proteins | 5e-183 | 0.67 |\n\n### Literature Evidence\nThe literature search revealed:\n- Direct evidence linking C4A/C4B gene copy numbers to complement component 4 serum concentrations\n- Studies showing C4A deficiency affects complement component 4 protein levels\n- Research demonstrating the relationship between RCCX module variations (including C4 genes) and C4 protein concentrations\n\n## Analysis and Justification\n\nWhile multiple genes show statistical associations, **C4A** emerges as the most likely causal gene for several reasons:\n\n1. **Direct Biological Relationship**: C4A directly encodes the alpha chain of complement component 4, making it the primary determinant of C4 protein concentration\n\n2. **Literature Support**: Multiple studies demonstrate that C4A gene copy numbers and variations directly influence circulating C4 protein levels\n\n3. **Biological Mechanism**: As the direct encoding gene, C4A variants would have the most straightforward mechanistic path to affecting protein concentration\n\n4. **Complement System Role**: C4 is a key component of the classical complement pathway, and its concentration is fundamental to complement system function\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**C4A** is identified as the most likely causal gene for neonatal circulating complement component 4 (C4) protein concentration based on its direct encoding function, strong biological rationale, and supporting literature evidence.\n\n---\n\n*Analysis conducted using systematic GWAS catalog query and literature review methods.*",
