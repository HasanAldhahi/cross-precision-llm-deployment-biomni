Based on this comprehensive analysis, the causal gene should be ENSG00000147155 (EBP).</think> Based on my comprehensive analysis of the patient's phenotypes and candidate genes: **Plan Update:** 1. [✓] Query HPO ontology to understand the patient's phenotypes 2. [✓] Load HPO ontology data from the data lake 3. [✓] Convert Ensembl gene IDs to gene symbols 4. [✓] Load disease association databases (OMIM, DisGeNET) 5. [✓] Analyze phenotype-disease associations for each candidate gene 6. [✓] Match patient phenotypes with disease phenotypes to identify the most likely causal gene 7. [✓] Provide the final answer in the required JSON format The patient presents with a constellation of phenotypes strongly suggestive of **Chondrodysplasia Punctata**, including: - Multiple skeletal dysplasia features (platyspondyly, brachydactyly, micromelia, bowing of long bones, abnormal metaphysis morphology, kyphosis, abnormal ilium morphology) - Cardiac defects (patent ductus arteriosus, atrial septal defect) - Joint stiffness and musculoskeletal abnormalities - Craniofacial features (macrocephaly, frontal bossing, large fontanelles) From the candidate genes, **ENSG00000147155 (EBP)** is specifically associated with: - \"Chondrodysplasia punctata, X-linked dominant\" - \"MEND syndrome\" This matches perfectly with the patient's phenotype constellation, making EBP the most likely causal gene. <solution> {'causal_gene': ['ENSG00000147155']} </solution>",
