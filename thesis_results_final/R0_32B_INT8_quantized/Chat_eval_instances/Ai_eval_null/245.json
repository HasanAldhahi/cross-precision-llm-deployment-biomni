This gene is well-established in mechanosensation pathways and has documented associations with multiple arthrogryposis conditions [1].\n\n### Phenotype-Disease Correlation\nThe patient's phenotypic presentation precisely matches the clinical features of Distal Arthrogryposis With Impaired Proprioception and Touch:\n\n1. **Ptosis (HP:0000508)** - Drooping of the upper eyelids, a documented feature of DAIPT\n2. **Joint contractures (HP:0000193, HP:0009473)** - Characteristic joint stiffness and reduced mobility seen in arthrogryposis conditions\n3. **Micrognathia (HP:0000347)** - Small jaw malformation consistent with the craniofacial features of DAIPT\n\n### Database Evidence\nAnalysis of the OMIM database revealed that PIEZO2 mutations underlie two distinct arthrogryposis conditions:\n- Arthrogryposis, distal, type 5 (OMIM: 108145)\n- Arthrogryposis, distal, with impaired proprioception and touch (OMIM: 617146)\n\nThe literature consistently identifies the combination of ptosis, joint contractures, micrognathia, and PIEZO2 mutations as characteristic of **Distal Arthrogryposis With Impaired Proprioception and Touch (DAIPT)**, which has OMIM ID **617146** [2,3].\n\n### Clinical Significance\nDAIPT is a rare autosomal recessive condition characterized by:\n- Multiple joint contractures affecting hands and other distal joints\n- Ptosis affecting eye movement and appearance\n- Craniofacial abnormalities including micrognathia\n- Impaired proprioception and touch sensation\n- Progressive musculoskeletal complications\n\nThis diagnosis provides a comprehensive explanation for the patient's phenotypic presentation and genetic findings.\n\n---\n\n**References:**\n[1] OMIM database entry for PIEZO2-associated conditions  \n[2] Functional characterization studies of PIEZO2 variants in DAIPT patients  \n[3] Multicenter clinical studies documenting PIEZO2-related arthrogryposis phenotypes",
