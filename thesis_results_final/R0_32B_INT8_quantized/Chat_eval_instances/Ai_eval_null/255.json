Gene identification and function using Ensembl database\n2. Disease associations from OMIM database\n3. Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) analysis of clinical features\n4. Cross-referencing of genetic and phenotypic evidence\n\n## Gene Analysis\n**ENSG00000143368** corresponds to the **SF3B4** gene (splicing factor 3b subunit 4), located on chromosome 1 at coordinates 149923317-149927803. This gene plays a crucial role in pre-mRNA splicing processes.\n\n## Disease Association Evidence\nAnalysis of the OMIM database revealed that SF3B4 variants are associated with:\n- **Acrofacial dysostosis 1, Nager type** (OMIM: 154400)\n- Inheritance pattern: Autosomal dominant\n- Disease type: DNA splice variant disorder\n\n## Phenotype Analysis\nThe patient's HPO codes correspond to the following clinical features:\n\n| HPO Code | Clinical Feature | Description |\n|----------|------------------|-------------|\n| HP:0007646 | Lack of eyelashes on the lower lid | Absent or sparse eyelashes specifically on the lower eyelid |\n| HP:0000347 | Anomaly of the midface | Structural abnormalities affecting the central facial region |\n| HP:0000175 | Cleft palate | Developmental defect in the roof of the mouth |\n| HP:0000365 | Decreased sensory perception of sound | Hearing impairment or reduced auditory sensitivity |\n| HP:0001172 | Abnormal structure of the first digit of the hand | Malformation affecting the thumb of the hand |\n\n## Diagnostic Assessment\nThe clinical features demonstrate strong correlation with Nager syndrome characteristics:\n- **Facial dysmorphism**: Midface anomalies and eyelid abnormalities are hallmark features\n- **Craniofacial malformations**: Cleft palate matches the syndrome's developmental pattern\n- **Limb defects**: Abnormal thumb structure is consistent with acrofacial dysostosis\n- **Hearing impairment**: Sensory hearing loss is commonly associated\n\n## Final Diagnosis\n**Acrofacial dysostosis 1, Nager type** (OMIM: 154400)\n\n## Confidence Level\nHigh confidence based on:\n- Direct gene-disease association in OMIM database\n- Consistent phenotypic profile with established diagnostic criteria\n- Single candidate gene matching the patient's genetic profile\n\n### JSON Output\n```json\n{\"disease_name\": \"Acrofacial dysostosis 1, Nager type\", \"OMIM_ID\": \"154400\"}\n```",
