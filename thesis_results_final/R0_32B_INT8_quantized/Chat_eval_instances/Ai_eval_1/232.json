The analysis involved:\n\n1. Querying the GWAS catalog for rheumatoid arthritis associations\n2. Cross-referencing 22 candidate genes against RA-specific associations\n3. Evaluating biological plausibility based on gene function\n\n## Key Findings\n\n### Primary Evidence: GWAS Associations\n- **IL6R** showed **7 direct associations** with rheumatoid arthritis in the catalog [1]\n- **IL6R** had associations with both general rheumatoid arthritis and ACPA-positive rheumatoid arthritis\n- **P-values** ranged from 1.1×10⁻⁸ to 5.0×10⁻⁶, indicating statistically significant associations\n- **OR/Beta coefficients** showed consistent effect sizes across studies (1.07-1.12)\n\n### Comparative Analysis\n- **21 of 22 genes** had no documented associations with rheumatoid arthritis in the comprehensive catalog\n- **IL6R** was the **sole gene** with direct RA associations\n- Other genes were involved in diverse cellular processes (RNA editing, lipid transport, cell cycle, etc.) without RA-specific connections\n\n### Biological Plausibility\nIL6R encodes the interleukin-6 receptor, which is directly involved in:\n- Inflammatory cytokine signaling pathways\n- Immune system regulation\n- Synovial inflammation and joint damage in RA\n- Established therapeutic target for RA treatment\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**IL6R** is the most likely causal gene for rheumatoid arthritis within this locus, supported by:\n- Exclusive presence in RA GWAS associations\n- Strong statistical evidence across multiple studies\n- Direct mechanistic involvement in RA pathogenesis\n\n---\n\n**References:**\n[1] GWAS Catalog analysis revealed multiple independent studies confirming IL6R's association with rheumatoid arthritis phenotypes",
