Glycogen storage diseases can present with seizures, neurological symptoms, and multi-system involvement, which matches the patient's phenotype profile. Given all this evidence, SLC37A4 (ENSG00000137700) appears to be the most likely causal gene.</think> <solution> {'causal_gene': ['ENSG00000137700']} </solution>",
