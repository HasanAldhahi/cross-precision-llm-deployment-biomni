Highest number of cardiovascular disease associations (13/13 genes)\n2. Strong biological mechanism linking cholesterol metabolism to cardiovascular risk\n3. Extensive literature support and clinical relevance\n4. Known role in familial hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerotic disease\n\n---\n\n**References:**\n[1] DisGeNET database analysis showing PCSK9 associations with 13 cardiovascular disease phenotypes  \n[2] Multiple literature sources confirming PCSK9's role in cardiovascular disease pathogenesis and treatment",
