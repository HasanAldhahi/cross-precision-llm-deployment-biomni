GWAS Catalog Analysis\n- Systematically searched for associations between the given genes and proline-related phenotypes\n- Filtered for entries specifically related to \"blood metabolite levels\" and \"proline\"\n\n### 2. Biological Function Analysis\n- Queried UniProt database for functional annotations of candidate genes\n- Focused on genes with known roles in amino acid metabolism or transport\n\n### 3. Prioritization Criteria\n- Direct GWAS associations with proline levels\n- Biological plausibility based on gene function\n- Known disease associations related to proline metabolism\n\n## Key Findings\n\n### GWAS Evidence\n**PRODH** showed the strongest association with blood proline levels:\n- **Association**: Plasma free proline levels\n- **P-value**: 2×10^-54 [1]\n- **Effect Size**: Large (likely affecting proline metabolism directly)\n\n### Biological Function Evidence\n**PRODH** encodes *Proline dehydrogenase 1, mitochondrial*:\n- **Function**: Catalyzes the first step in proline degradation by converting proline to delta-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate [2]\n- **EC Number**: 1.5.5.2 (proline oxidase)\n- **Disease Association**: Mutations cause Hyperprolinemia 1, a disorder characterized by elevated plasma and urinary proline levels [3]\n\n### Other Candidate Genes\n**SLC25A1** showed no direct association with proline levels:\n- Encodes mitochondrial citrate carrier\n- Transports citrate, isocitrate, and other tricarboxylates\n- Related to fatty acid synthesis and glycolysis regulation, not proline metabolism\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**PRODH** is identified as the most likely causal gene for blood proline levels based on:\n\n1. **Statistical Evidence**: Direct GWAS association with p-value of 2×10^-54\n2. **Biological Mechanism**: Encodes the enzyme responsible for proline degradation\n3. **Clinical Relevance**: Known to cause hyperprolinemia when mutated\n4. **Pathway Integration**: Central role in L-proline → L-glutamate metabolic pathway\n\nThe convergence of genetic association data and biological function provides strong support for PRODH as the causal gene affecting blood proline concentrations.\n\n## References\n[1] GWAS Catalog: Direct association with plasma free proline levels (max_papers=10)  \n[2] UniProt O43272: Proline dehydrogenase 1, mitochondrial functional annotation  \n[3] UniProt disease association data: Hyperprolinemia 1 (DI-01782)",
