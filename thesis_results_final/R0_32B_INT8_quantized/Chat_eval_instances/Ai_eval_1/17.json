While rs2970818 shows stronger association with serum phosphate levels, rs4687717 is the only variant specifically associated with the phosphorus metabolism pathway that directly relates to both components of the phenotype.\n\n## Recommendation\n\n**rs4687717** is recommended as the top priority variant for further examination based on its direct association with the target phenotype and significant p-value. This variant is located in the TKT gene, which encodes transketolase - a key enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway that could be mechanistically relevant to phosphate-erythronate metabolism.\n\n---\n\nThis analysis provides a clear, evidence-based prioritization using GWAS Catalog data and direct phenotype matching criteria.",
