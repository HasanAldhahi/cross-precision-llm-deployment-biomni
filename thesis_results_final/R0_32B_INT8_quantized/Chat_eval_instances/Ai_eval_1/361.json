This mechanism is central to:\n\n- Glucose sensing and uptake\n- Insulin secretion regulation  \n- Metabolic homeostasis\n- Diabetes pathogenesis\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**GCKR** is identified as the most likely causal gene for Type 2 diabetes in this locus based on:\n- Multiple database associations with diabetes phenotypes\n- Strong literature evidence for biological function in glucose metabolism\n- Direct involvement in diabetes-related genetic variants\n- Clear mechanistic role in glucose-insulin homeostasis\n\n## References\n\n[1] DisGeNET database analysis showed GCKR associations with multiple diabetes-related disorders  \n[2] Current Insight on the Role of Glucokinase and Glucokinase Regulatory Protein in Diabetes (PMID: 37612862)  \n[3] Interaction between GCKR rs1260326 variant and metabolic parameters in T2D individuals (PMID: 37648893)  \n[4] GCKR and metabolic effects in NAFLD studies (PMID: 29648650)  \n[5] Acetylation mechanisms affecting glucose metabolism via GCKR (PMID: 26620281)",
