The analysis included:\n\n- GWAS Catalog queries for diabetes associations\n- Literature searches using PubMed for each gene\n- Functional pathway analysis\n- Disease mechanism evaluation\n\n## Key Findings\n\n### Primary Candidates: ABCC8 and KCNJ11\n\nBoth **ABCC8** and **KCNJ11** encode subunits of the ATP-sensitive potassium (K_ATP) channel in pancreatic beta cells, a critical component for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion [1].\n\n**ABCC8** encodes the SUR1 regulatory subunit, while **KCNJ11** encodes the Kir6.2 pore-forming subunit [2].\n\n### Evidence for KCNJ11\n\n- **Direct T2D Associations**: Multiple studies specifically identify KCNJ11 variants in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus association studies [3]\n- **Functional Relevance**: K_ATP channels are essential for insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis\n- **Clinical Evidence**: Mutations in KCNJ11 cause neonatal diabetes and are established diabetes susceptibility genes\n\n### Evidence for Other Genes\n\nThe remaining genes showed limited direct associations with Type 2 Diabetes:\n- **CXCL genes** (CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL3, CXCL5, CXCL6, CXCL8): Primarily associated with inflammatory processes and psoriasis\n- **RPS13, PIK3C2A**: Some diabetes-related expression changes but minimal causal evidence\n- **Other genes**: No significant diabetes associations found in literature\n\n## Biological Rationale\n\nThe K_ATP channel represents the primary mechanism by which pancreatic beta cells sense glucose levels and respond with appropriate insulin secretion. Disruption of this channel through mutations in either ABCC8 or KCNJ11 directly impairs glucose homeostasis, making these genes the most biologically plausible candidates for Type 2 Diabetes causation.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWhile both ABCC8 and KCNJ11 are strongly associated with diabetes, **KCNJ11** demonstrates the strongest evidence for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus specifically, with direct GWAS associations and well-established clinical relevance to adult-onset diabetes.\n\n---\n\n**References:**\n[1] Literature evidence showing both genes encode K_ATP channel components critical for insulin secretion  \n[2] Functional studies demonstrating the role of SUR1 and Kir6.2 in glucose sensing and insulin release  \n[3] Multiple T2D association studies specifically identifying KCNJ11 variants",
