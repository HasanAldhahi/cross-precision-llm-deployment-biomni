DNAH11 encodes a dynein heavy chain essential for ciliary motility, and mutations cause severe respiratory distress, situs inversus, and multi-system complications during development.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBased on systematic phenotype-gene association analysis, **DNAH11** shows the strongest evidence as the causal gene due to direct matching of the key diagnostic feature (situs inversus) and comprehensive explanation of the respiratory and developmental phenotype cluster.",
