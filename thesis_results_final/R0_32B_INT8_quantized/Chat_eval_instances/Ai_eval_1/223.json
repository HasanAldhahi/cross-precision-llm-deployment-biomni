PubMed literature search for psoriasis disease mechanisms and pathways\n2. Systematic review of GWAS catalog for psoriasis associations with candidate genes\n3. Functional analysis of genes within the locus\n4. Assessment of biological relevance to psoriasis pathogenesis\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**CXCL8** emerges as the most likely causal gene for psoriasis based on its direct involvement in inflammatory pathways, neutrophil recruitment mechanisms, and therapeutic response prediction in psoriasis patients.\n\n---\n\n### References\n[1] TNF-α promotes CXCL-1/8 production in keratinocytes through NF-κB pathway  \n[2] Transcriptomic identification of immune-related hubs for therapeutic response prediction  \n[3] AMPK activation modulates IL-36-induced inflammatory responses regulating IκBζ expression  \n[4] Spesolimab treatment effects on CXCL8 production in generalized pustular psoriasis",
