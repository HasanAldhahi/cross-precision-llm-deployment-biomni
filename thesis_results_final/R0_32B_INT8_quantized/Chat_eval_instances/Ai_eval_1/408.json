This analysis evaluated 30 genes from the locus to identify the most biologically plausible causal gene for this phenotype.\n\n## Key Findings\n\n### CETP Shows Strong Evidence for Sex-Specific Effects\n\n1. **Direct Literature Evidence**: Multiple publications specifically addressing CETP's sex-specific effects were identified, including studies on:\n   - Sex-specific effects of CETP on perivascular adipose tissue [1]\n   - Estrogen receptor-α mediated effects of CETP expression in female mice [2]\n   - Sex differences in CETP's impact on lipid metabolism [3]\n\n2. **Multi-trait Metabolic Effects**: CETP affects multiple interconnected metabolic traits including:\n   - HDL cholesterol levels\n   - LDL cholesterol levels  \n   - Triglyceride metabolism\n   - Lipid profiles\n\n3. **Biological Mechanism**: CETP demonstrates sex-specific effects through regulation of:\n   - Endothelial nitric oxide synthase pathways\n   - Estrogen receptor-α signaling\n   - Sex-specific lipid metabolism regulation\n\n### Other Candidate Genes Show Limited Evidence\n\n**BBS2**: Associated with Bardet-Biedl syndrome, a ciliopathy affecting multiple systems, but no strong sex-specific associations identified.\n\n**CCL17, CCL22, CX3CL1**: Chemokine genes involved in immune function and inflammatory responses, with no evidence for sex-specific effects on metabolic traits.\n\n**COQ9**: Involved in mitochondrial function and coenzyme Q biosynthesis, no strong sex-related associations found.\n\n**HERPUD1, NUP93, RSPRY1, SLC12A3**: Other genes showed limited evidence for sex-specific effects, with functions primarily in protein processing, nuclear transport, RNA binding, and ion transport.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**CETP** emerges as the most likely causal gene for Multi-trait sex score based on:\n- Well-documented sex-specific effects across multiple metabolic traits\n- Biological plausibility through known estrogen receptor-α and lipid metabolism pathways\n- Strong literature support for different impacts in males vs females\n- Relevance to composite multi-trait phenotypes that capture sex differences\n\nThe evidence strongly supports CETP as the causal gene due to its established role in sex-specific lipid metabolism and multi-trait effects that align with the definition of Multi-trait sex score.\n\n---\n\n**References:**\n[1] Sex-Specific Effects of Cholesteryl Ester Transfer Protein (CETP) on the Perivascular Adipose Tissue  \n[2] CETP expression ameliorates endothelial function in female mice through estrogen receptor-α and endothelial nitric oxide synthase pathway  \n[3] Study of effect modifiers of genetically predicted CETP reduction",
