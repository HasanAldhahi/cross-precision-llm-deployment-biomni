PubMed literature search for B-cell lymphoma associations\n2. DisGeNET database analysis for disease-gene relationships\n3. OMIM database review for phenotype-gene associations\n4. Knowledge graph analysis for direct disease associations\n5. Cross-validation of findings across multiple databases\n\n## Results\n\n### Literature Evidence\nMultiple recent publications demonstrate BTK's involvement in B-cell lymphoma:\n- Acalabrutinib as therapeutic approach for primary CNS B-cell lymphoma [1]\n- BTK inhibitors used for maintenance therapy in CNS lymphoma [2]\n- Research on BTK inhibitor-resistant chronic lymphocytic leukemia [3]\n- Studies showing ibrutinib promoting ferroptosis in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma [4]\n\n### Database Analysis\n**DisGeNET Disease-Gene Associations:**\n- BTK appears in **13 distinct lymphoma-related disorders** [5]\n- Specific B-cell lymphoma associations include:\n  - Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma\n  - Follicular Lymphoma\n  - Aggressive Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma\n  - B-Cell Lymphomas (general category)\n  - Primary central nervous system lymphoma\n  - Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma\n  - Splenic Marginal Zone B-Cell Lymphoma\n\n### Comparative Analysis\nAmong all candidate genes examined:\n- **BTK**: 13 lymphoma associations\n- **NOX1**: 3 lymphoma associations (primarily pseudolymphoma)\n- **TIMM8A**: 2 lymphoma associations (T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia)\n- **Other genes**: No significant lymphoma associations found\n\n## Biological Rationale\n\nBTK plays a crucial role in:\n- B-cell development and differentiation\n- B-cell receptor signaling pathways\n- Adaptive immune system function\n\nDysregulation or mutations in BTK can lead to impaired B-cell function and malignancy development. BTK inhibitors are FDA-approved therapeutic agents for treating B-cell malignancies, confirming its central role in disease pathogenesis.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**BTK** is the most likely causal gene for B-Cell Lymphoma based on:\n- Extensive literature support demonstrating therapeutic relevance\n- Multiple database associations with B-cell lymphoma subtypes\n- Well-established biological mechanism in B-cell development\n- Clinical validation through approved BTK inhibitor therapies\n\n## References\n\n[1] Acalabrutinib May Offer a New Therapeutic Approach for Consolidation and Maintenance of Primary CNS Lymphoma (Int J Mol Sci, PMID: 41226558)\n\n[2] Sustained remission with PD-1 and BTK inhibitors maintenance after chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy in CNS lymphoma (Cancer Immunol Immunother, PMID: 41222665)\n\n[3] PKCβ inhibitor MS-553 displays preclinical efficacy in BTK inhibitor-resistant Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (Blood Cancer Discov, PMID: 41190953)\n\n[4] Redox destabilization by ibrutinib promotes ferroptosis in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (Cell Death Discov, PMID: 41173858)\n\n[5] DisGeNET database analysis showing BTK associations with 13 lymphoma-related disorders",
