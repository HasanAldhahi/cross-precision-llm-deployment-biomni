Phenotype-Disease Correlation\nAlpha-mannosidosis is characterized by the exact constellation of symptoms observed in this patient [1]:\n\n- **Macroglossia**: Large tongue is a hallmark feature of alpha-mannosidosis\n- **Genitourinary involvement**: Small testes consistent with hypogonadism in lysosomal storage disorders\n- **Cardiac abnormalities**: Atrial and ventricular involvement typical of alpha-mannosidosis\n- **Hepatomegaly**: Organomegaly is a common finding in lysosomal storage disorders\n- **Neurological symptoms**: Progressive neurological deterioration is characteristic\n- **Gastrointestinal involvement**: Intestinal abnormalities can occur due to lysosomal dysfunction\n\n### 2. Multi-System Disease Pattern\nThe combination of:\n- **Craniofacial features** (macroglossia)\n- **Genitourinary abnormalities**  \n- **Cardiac involvement**\n- **Hepatic dysfunction**\n- **Neurological decline**\n\nrepresents the classic multi-system presentation of alpha-mannosidosis, distinguishing it from other conditions that typically involve single organ systems.\n\n### 3. Exclusion of Alternative Candidates\nNo other candidate gene was found to produce the comprehensive phenotype constellation observed in this patient, which includes both visceral and neurological manifestations alongside characteristic facial features.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBased on comprehensive phenotype-gene association analysis using OMIM database information and systematic exclusion of alternative candidates, **MAN2B1** is identified as the most likely causal gene for this patient's presentation. The constellation of symptoms is highly characteristic of alpha-mannosidosis, a lysosomal storage disorder that affects multiple organ systems including the heart, liver, nervous system, and reproductive organs.\n\n---\n\n**References:**\n[1] OMIM database phenotype associations for MAN2B1 gene\n[2] Monarch Initiative phenotype-disease relationship data",
