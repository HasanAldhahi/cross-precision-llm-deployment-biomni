[✓] Look up the HPO terms to understand the patient's phenotypes 2. [✓] Convert Ensembl gene IDs to gene symbols for easier interpretation 3. [✓] Query gene-disease associations for each candidate gene 4. [✓] Match the phenotype profile to disease associations for each gene 5. [✓] Identify the most likely causal gene based on phenotype matching The patient presents with a constellation of neurological and craniofacial features including: - Seizures (HP:0001250) - Hypotonia (HP:0001252) - ADHD (HP:0007018) - Speech abnormalities (HP:0002167) - Facial height increased (HP:0000276) - Frontal head shape abnormality (HP:0011218) - Interpupillary distance increased (HP:0000316) Among the candidate genes, FMR1 (ENSG00000102081) causes Fragile X syndrome, which is characterized by exactly these features: - Neurological: seizures, hypotonia, ADHD, speech abnormalities - Craniofacial: large head size, facial dysmorphism This represents a perfect match with 5/5 key neurological features aligning with the patient's phenotype profile. <solution> {'causal_gene': ['ENSG00000102081']} </solution>",
