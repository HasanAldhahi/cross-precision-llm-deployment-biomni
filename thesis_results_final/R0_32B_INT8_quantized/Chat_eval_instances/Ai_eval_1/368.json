The gene's role in proteasome assembly suggests potential involvement in cellular metabolism and insulin processing pathways relevant to diabetes pathogenesis.\n\n## Evidence-Based Recommendation\n\n**PAM** should be prioritized for functional studies and therapeutic targeting based on its strong genetic association evidence with Type 2 diabetes.",
