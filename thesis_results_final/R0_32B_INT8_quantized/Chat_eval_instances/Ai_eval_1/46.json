Its selection is supported by strong functional evidence and established connections to Salmonella infection susceptibility, ensuring maximum perturbation effects on the studied phenotype.\n\n## References\n\nKey literature supporting this analysis includes studies on STAT1's role in:\n- IFNγ-mediated Salmonella clearance mechanisms\n- Bacterial infection susceptibility in STAT1-deficient patients\n- Interferon-stimulated gene regulation during pathogen exposure\n- Immune response pathway modulation in infected non-phagocytic cells",
