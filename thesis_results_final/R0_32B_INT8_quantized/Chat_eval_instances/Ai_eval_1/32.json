The task required prioritization for HDL cholesterol measurement, making direct phenotype matching critical.\n\nrs2366858 emerged as the optimal choice because it:\n1. Shows direct associations with HDL cholesterol phenotypes\n2. Has substantial effect sizes (β=0.0325 and β=1.398273)\n3. Maps to biologically relevant genes CD36-SEMA3C involved in lipid metabolism\n4. Demonstrates consistent associations across multiple HDL cholesterol measurement phenotypes\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**rs2366858** is the most promising variant for further examination based on its direct association with HDL cholesterol measurement, strong statistical significance, and substantial effect sizes.",
