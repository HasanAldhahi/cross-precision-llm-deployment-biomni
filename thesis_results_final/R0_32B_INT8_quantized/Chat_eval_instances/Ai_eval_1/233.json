Direct evidence linking chemokine receptors to cutaneous lymphoma development in canine models\n2. Multiple studies showing CCR4's role in T-cell biology and immune function\n3. Evidence that chemokine receptor knockout suppresses lymphoma metastasis and growth\n\n### Database Analysis\n- **OMIM Database**: CCR4 found with associations to intellectual developmental disorders, while most other genes showed no phenotype associations\n- **DisGeNET Database**: Limited lymphoma associations found for any of the candidate genes\n- **UniProt Analysis**: Confirmed CCR4's role as a chemokine receptor with phosphatase activity important for metabolic regulation\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**CCR4** is identified as the most likely causal gene for T-Cell Cutaneous Lymphoma based on:\n- Direct literature evidence linking chemokine receptors to cutaneous lymphoma\n- Essential role in T-cell biology and immune cell trafficking\n- Central position as the namesake gene of the CCR4-NOT complex\n- Known involvement in lymphoma-related processes including metastasis and tumor growth regulation\n\nThis analysis provides strong evidence supporting CCR4 as the primary candidate gene for T-Cell Cutaneous Lymphoma susceptibility in this genomic locus.",
