The patient presents with a constellation of phenotypes including cardiac defects (atrial septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus), skeletal abnormalities (platyspondyly, bowing of long bones, brachydactyly, micromelia), craniofacial features (broad forehead, macrocephaly, large fontanelles), and other features (redundant skin, joint stiffness, narrow chest). Among the candidate genes, **JAG1 (ENSG00000101384)** is associated with Alagille syndrome 1, which involves: - Congenital heart defects (atrial septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus) - Skeletal abnormalities (platyspondyly, bowing of long bones, brachydactyly) - Craniofacial features (broad forehead, macrocephaly) JAG1 matches 7 key phenotypes from the patient, representing the best match among all candidate genes for this specific phenotype constellation. <solution> {'causal_gene': ['ENSG00000101384']} </solution>",
