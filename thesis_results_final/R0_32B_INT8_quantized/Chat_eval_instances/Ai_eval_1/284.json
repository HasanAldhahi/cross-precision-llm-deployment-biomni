ANXA3**\n\n## Evidence\nThe analysis was conducted using definitive data from the MSigDB C6 collection, which contains experimentally validated gene sets. The gene set ESC_J1_UP_EARLY.V1_DN specifically captures the transcriptional changes occurring during early differentiation of J1 embryonic stem cells, making ANXA3's presence biologically relevant to stem cell differentiation processes [1].\n\n---\n**References:**\n[1] MSigDB C6 Oncogenic Signature Gene Sets - Experimental data derived from J1 embryonic stem cell differentiation studies (PMID: 17394647)",
