This enzyme catalyzes the acylation of lysophosphatidic acid to form phosphatidic acid, which serves as a precursor to phosphatidylcholine and other phospholipids [2].\n\n### GWAS Evidence\n\nMultiple significant associations were identified between AGPAT1 and phosphatidylcholine levels in the GWAS catalog:\n\n- **PC 32:0 levels**: Associated with AGPAT1 (P-values: 6e-19, 4e-22, 3e-23, 2e-37)\n- **PC 34:1 levels**: Not directly found but related phospholipid species showed associations\n- **Phosphatidylcholine_32:0**: Associated with AGPAT1 (P-values: 1e-15, 9e-17)\n\n### Phenotype Relevance\n\nThe GWAS phenotype specifically asks about the ratio of PC 32:0 to PC 34:1 phosphatidylcholine species in plasma. AGPAT1's role in phospholipid biosynthesis and substrate specificity for different fatty acids makes it the most mechanistically relevant gene for controlling these specific phospholipid proportions [3].\n\n### Alternative Candidates\n\nOther genes in the locus showed less direct relevance:\n- **ABHD16A**: Involved in fatty acid metabolism, not phospholipid biosynthesis\n- **CYP21A2**: Involved in steroid hormone biosynthesis  \n- **PPT2**: Associated with phospholipid levels but typically in combination with AGPAT1\n- **SLC44A4**: Involved in solute transport, not biosynthesis\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**AGPAT1** is the most likely causal gene based on its direct involvement in phospholipid biosynthesis, strong GWAS associations with phosphatidylcholine levels, and mechanistic relevance to controlling fatty acid composition in membrane phospholipids.\n\n---\n\n*Analysis based on systematic review of 56 genes in the locus, GWAS catalog search results, and functional annotation data.*\n\n[1] AGPAT1 encodes the rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of phospholipids  \n[2] Catalyzes formation of phosphatidic acid, precursor to phosphatidylcholine  \n[3] Substrate specificity allows control of different fatty acid compositions in phospholipids",
