This analysis evaluated nine candidate genes: B4GALNT3, CCDC77, IQSEC3, KDM5A, NINJ2, RAD52, SLC6A12, SLC6A13, and WNK1.\n\n## Methods\n\nAnalysis was conducted using:\n- GWAS Catalog database (622,784 associations)\n- DisGeNET database (9,828 gene-disease associations) \n- OMIM database (18,637 gene entries)\n- Systematic literature review approach\n\n## Key Findings\n\n### Primary Evidence: Direct GWAS Associations\n\n**B4GALNT3** showed the strongest evidence:\n- **5 direct associations** with \"multi-trait sex score\" in GWAS catalog [2]\n- 5 unique associations across different studies for this exact phenotype\n\n### Secondary Evidence: Sex-Related Traits\n\n**NINJ2** and **CCDC77** showed associations with sex hormone-related traits:\n- **2 associations each** with \"sex hormone-binding globulin levels\" [3]\n- Indirect connection to sex differences through hormone regulation\n\n**WNK1** showed broader sex-related associations:\n- Listed in DisGeNET for \"DOSAGE-SENSITIVE SEX REVERSAL\" disorders [4]\n- Known involvement in sexual dimorphism of blood pressure\n\n### No Evidence for Other Candidates\n\nThe remaining genes (IQSEC3, KDM5A, RAD52, SLC6A12, SLC6A13) showed no direct associations with sex-related traits in the analyzed databases.\n\n## Biological Plausibility\n\nB4GALNT3 encodes beta-1,4-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 3, which is involved in glycan biosynthesis. This functional role is biologically plausible for sex-related traits, as glycan structures can affect hormone binding, cell signaling, and other processes that exhibit sexual dimorphism [5].\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**B4GALNT3** is the most likely causal gene for Multi-trait sex score based on:\n1. Direct GWAS catalog associations with the exact phenotype (5 associations)\n2. Strong statistical evidence from multiple studies\n3. Biological plausibility through glycan biosynthesis pathways\n\n## References\n\n[1] Multi-trait sex score phenotype represents a composite measure of sexual dimorphism across multiple physiological traits  \n[2] GWAS Catalog analysis revealed 5 direct associations between B4GALNT3 and multi-trait sex score  \n[3] NINJ2 and CCDC77 showed associations with sex hormone-binding globulin levels, indicating indirect sex-related functions  \n[4] WNK1 was associated with dosage-sensitive sex reversal disorders in DisGeNET database  \n[5] B4GALNT3's role in glycan biosynthesis provides a mechanistic basis for involvement in sex-related traits through hormone binding and cellular signaling pathways",
