Drug resistance in cancer cells often involves changes in gene expression and epigenetic regulation, making DPY30 highly relevant to the phenotype of interest. DMSO exposure can affect cellular processes including: - Protein structure and function - Gene expression patterns - Cellular stress responses - Epigenetic modifications Since DPY30 is directly involved in drug resistance mechanisms through histone methylation regulation, and DMSO can affect epigenetic processes, perturbation of DPY30 would likely have the strongest effect on drug resistance phenotypes in this experimental context. <solution>DPY30</solution>",

The experimental context involves: - BRCA2 knockout in HeLa cells (which affects homologous recombination) - Olaparib treatment (a PARP inhibitor targeting DNA repair) - Study of resistance mechanisms The literature clearly demonstrates that histone genes, particularly those involved in chromatin remodeling and DNA repair processes, are directly mechanistically linked to PARP inhibitor resistance.
