Based on the comprehensive examination of patient phenotypes and candidate gene associations, FKRP (ENSG00000181027) is identified as the causal gene. This gene matches 7 out of 12 key patient phenotypes and is associated with congenital muscular dystrophy with brain and eye anomalies, which explains the complex constellation of symptoms including neurological, ocular, and developmental features. </observation> [74] ASSISTANT: <think>Based on my analysis, I have identified that FKRP (ENSG00000181027) is the most likely causal gene for the patient's complex phenotype pattern. The evidence shows that FKRP matches 7 out of 12 key patient phenotypes and is associated with congenital muscular dystrophy with brain and eye anomalies, which explains the constellation of symptoms including neurological, ocular, and developmental features. I need to provide the final answer in the specified format: {'causal_gene': [gene1]} The analysis shows that FKRP is the best match, so the answer should be:</think> <solution> {'causal_gene': ['ENSG00000181027']} </solution>",
