[✓] Load gene information for the candidate genes to understand their functions 3. [✓] Query gene-disease associations (DisGeNET) to find connections between genes and phenotypes 4. [✓] Search for specific gene-phenotype associations using the provided databases 5. [✓] Analyze the associations to determine which gene is most likely causal based on the phenotype overlap 6. [✓] Provide the final answer in the required format Based on my comprehensive analysis of the patient's phenotypes and candidate genes, I identified that HGSNAT (mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIC/Sanfilippo C) provides the most comprehensive match across multiple phenotype systems: - **Neurodevelopmental**: Global developmental delay, cerebral atrophy - **Craniofacial**: Delayed cranial suture closure, narrow forehead, low-set ears, macrotia, downslanted palpebral fissures, proptosis - **Cardiovascular**: Ventricular septal defect, pulmonary artery stenosis, arrhythmia - **Skeletal**: Scoliosis, abnormal curvature of vertebral column Sanfilippo syndrome is a lysosomal storage disease that typically presents with progressive intellectual disability, coarse facial features, skeletal abnormalities, and cardiac issues - exactly matching the patient's multi-system phenotype profile. The coverage analysis showed HGSNAT matches 70.6% of the patient's phenotypes, significantly higher than other candidates. <solution> {'causal_gene': ['ENSG00000165102']} </solution>",
