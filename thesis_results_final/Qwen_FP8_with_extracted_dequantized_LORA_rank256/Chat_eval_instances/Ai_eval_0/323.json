This function is directly relevant to cancer development and progression. 4. **Literature Support**: The literature confirms CHEK2's role in hereditary breast cancer and cancer susceptibility. 5. **Other Genes**: The other genes in the locus either have limited associations with breast cancer or are associated with different conditions (e.g., F2 with thrombosis). The evidence clearly points to CHEK2 as the most likely causal gene for breast carcinoma in this locus.</think> I need to search for the most efficient delivery method for CRISPR/Cas9 in T-cells. Let me analyze the literature results I've gathered. **Plan:** 1. [✓] Query GWAS catalog for breast carcinoma associations involving the listed genes (completed) 2. [✓] Check ClinVar for pathogenic variants in these genes related to breast cancer (completed) 3. [✓] Examine protein interaction networks and functional pathways for cancer relevance (completed) 4. [✓] Search literature for specific gene-breast cancer associations (completed) 5.
