Let me update my plan and provide the final answer in the requested format. **Updated Plan:** 1. [✓] Look up the HPO terms to understand the patient's phenotypes 2. [✓] Query OMIM data to find diseases associated with the candidate gene ENSG00000154864 3. [✓] Match the phenotypes with the gene's associated diseases to find the correct diagnosis 4. [✓] Format the output as requested JSON The patient's phenotypes are: - HP:0000508: Ptosis - HP:0000193: Bifid uvula - HP:0009473: Joint contracture of the hand - HP:0000347: Micrognathia The candidate gene ENSG00000154864 corresponds to PIEZO2, which is associated with Marden-Walker syndrome (OMIM ID: 248700). This syndrome is characterized by a combination of congenital contractures, ptosis, and other features that match the patient's phenotypes.</think> <solution> { \"disease_name\": \"Marden-Walker syndrome\", \"OMIM_ID\": \"248700\" } </solution>",
