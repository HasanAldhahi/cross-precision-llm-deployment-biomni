[✓] Analyze the evidence to determine the most likely causal gene 5. [✓] Output the result in the required format **Analysis Summary:** - **Patient Phenotypes:** The patient has multiple phenotypes related to spastic paraplegia and neurological disorders, including: - HP:0002493: Spastic paraplegia - HP:0100710: Spastic paraplegia - HP:0001276: Spastic paraplegia - HP:0000737: Irritability - HP:0001300: Parkinsonism - HP:0002063: Rigidity - HP:0001347: Hyperreflexia - HP:0001288: Gait disturbance - HP:0000648: Optic atrophy - HP:0001539: Ataxia - **Candidate Gene Analysis:** I checked all candidate genes against OMIM database and found: - **ENSG00000169359 (SLC33A1):** Associated with *Spastic paraplegia 42, autosomal dominant* and *Huppke-Brendel syndrome* - Other genes were associated with different conditions like immunodeficiency, muscular dystrophy, Alport syndrome, etc. - **Evidence:** ENSG00000169359 is the **only candidate gene** that has a direct association with spastic paraplegia, which matches the patient's primary phenotype cluster. <solution> {'causal_gene': ['ENSG00000169359']} </solution>",
