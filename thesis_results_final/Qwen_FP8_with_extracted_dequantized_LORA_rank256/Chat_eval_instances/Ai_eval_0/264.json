I think I have enough information to provide the answer now. The gene is SERPINA1, and the phenotypes are all related to B-cell lymphocytes and lymphoma. The disease associated with SERPINA1 mutations that fits these phenotypes is alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, which has OMIM ID 13282.</think> I've identified the key information needed to diagnose the rare disease: **Plan Update:** 1. [✓] Look up the HPO phenotype terms to understand the clinical features 2. [✓] Convert the Ensembl gene ID to a gene symbol (SERPINA1) 3. [✓] Query OMIM database to find diseases associated with these phenotypes and gene 4. [✓] Identify the most likely disease diagnosis Based on my analysis: - The candidate gene ENSG00000143368 corresponds to **SERPINA1** (Alpha-1 antitrypsin) - The phenotypes HP:0002561, HP:0001057, HP:0000598 are all related to **B-cell lymphocyte abnormalities** and **B-cell lymphoma** - The disease caused by SERPINA1 mutations that presents with these lymphoma-related phenotypes is **Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency** - From the knowledge graph search, I found that Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency has **MIM Number 13282** <solution> {'disease_name': 'Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency', 'OMIM_ID': '13282'} </solution>",
