Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome, caused by OFD1 mutations, matches the patient's complex multi-system phenotype pattern best, including intellectual disability, growth problems, neurological features, and multiple systemic abnormalities. Let me provide the answer in the required format.</think> <solution> {'causal_gene': ['ENSG00000046651']} </solution>",
