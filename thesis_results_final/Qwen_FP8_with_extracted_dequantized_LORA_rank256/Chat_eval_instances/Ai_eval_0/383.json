From the search results, I can see that the CUL4B gene is associated with MONDO:0007523, which is \"Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, hypermobility type\". The OMIM ID for this condition is 130020. Let me check the current search results to find the specific information. I can see that the xref for MONDO:0007523 includes \"OMIM:130020\" and the name is \"Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, hypermobility type\". This seems to be the most relevant result for the CUL4B gene and developmental epileptic encephalopathy. Let me confirm this is the correct association and provide the final answer.</think> I need to find the disease name and OMIM ID for the CUL4B gene and developmental epileptic encephalopathy.
