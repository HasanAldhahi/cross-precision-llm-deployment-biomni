Final diagnosis verification: Candidate gene: ENSG00000141556 (TBCD) Patient phenotypes: HP:0001250: Seizure, HP:0002169: Clonus, HP:0002312: Clumsiness, HP:0002069: Bilateral tonic-clonic seizure Associated disease: Encephalopathy, progressive, early-onset, with brain atrophy and thin corpus callosum OMIM ID: 617193 Literature confirmation: TBCD mutations are associated with progressive encephalopathy featuring: - Seizures/epilepsy - Clonus (involuntary muscle contractions) - Motor coordination issues (clumsiness) - Brain atrophy and thin corpus callosum All patient phenotypes are consistent with TBCD-related progressive encephalopathy </observation> [70] ASSISTANT: <think> Based on my analysis: 1. The candidate gene ENSG00000141556 corresponds to TBCD (Tubulin-specific chaperone D) 2. The patient's phenotypes are: - HP:0001250: Seizure - HP:0002169: Clonus - HP:0002312: Clumsiness - HP:0002069: Bilateral tonic-clonic seizure 3. From the OMIM database, I found that TBCD is associated with: - \"Encephalopathy, progressive, early-onset, with brain atrophy and thin corpus callosum\" (OMIM ID: 617193) 4. Literature searches confirmed that TBCD mutations cause progressive encephalopathy with symptoms including seizures, clonus, and motor coordination issues, which matches the patient's phenotypes perfectly. The diagnosis is: Encephalopathy, progressive, early-onset, with brain atrophy and thin corpus callosum (OMIM ID: 617193) </think> <solution> { \"disease_name\": \"Encephalopathy, progressive, early-onset, with brain atrophy and thin corpus callosum\", \"OMIM_ID\": \"617193\" } </solution>",
