  "last_200_tokens": "can be delivered into T-cells using electroporation techniques. 3. **Ribonucleoprotein (RNP) Delivery**: This involves delivering the Cas9 protein along with guide RNA as a pre-formed complex, which is often done through electroporation or other transfection methods. 4. **Transposon Systems**: Some studies mention the use of transposon-based delivery systems for CRISPR components. 5. **Viral Vector Systems**: Besides lentivirus, other viral vectors may be used depending on the specific application and safety considerations. The most commonly mentioned methods in the literature are lentivirus delivery and electroporation-based methods (both for DNA plasmids and RNPs). These methods are preferred for their efficiency and safety profiles in T-cell engineering applications. <solution> Based on my literature search, the most common and effective delivery methods for CRISPR/Cas9 in T-cell engineering are: 1. **Lentivirus Delivery of Cas9**: This method uses lentiviral vectors to deliver the Cas9 gene into T-cells, allowing for stable integration and expression. 2. **Electroporation of DNA Plasmids**: Plasmid DNA encoding Cas9 and guide RNAs is delivered into T-cells using electroporation techniques. 3. **Ribonucleoprotein (RNP) Delivery**: Pre-formed Cas9 protein complexes with guide RNA are delivered through electroporation or other transfection methods.
