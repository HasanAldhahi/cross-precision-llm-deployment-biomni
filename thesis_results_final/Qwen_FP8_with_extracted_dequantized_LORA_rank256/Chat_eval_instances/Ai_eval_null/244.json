The candidate gene ENSG00000141556 maps to TBCD (Tubulin-specific chaperone D) according to the gene_info database. 2. From the OMIM database, I found that TBCD is associated with \"Encephalopathy, progressive, early-onset, with brain atrophy and thin corpus callosum\" with MIM Number 604649. 3. The literature confirms that TBCD mutations cause progressive encephalopathy with brain atrophy and thin corpus callosum, which presents with seizures, clonus, and motor dysfunction - matching the given phenotypes. The phenotypes provided are: - HP:0001250: Seizure (multiple occurrences) - HP:0002169: Clonus - HP:0002312: Clumsiness - HP:0002069: Bilateral tonic-clonic seizure These phenotypes are consistent with progressive encephalopathy with brain atrophy and thin corpus callosum caused by TBCD mutations. So the diagnosis is: - Disease name: Encephalopathy, progressive, early-onset, with brain atrophy and thin corpus callosum - OMIM ID: 604649 I should present this in the required JSON format. </think> <solution> {\"disease_name\": \"Encephalopathy, progressive, early-onset, with brain atrophy and thin corpus callosum\", \"OMIM_ID\": \"604649\"} </solution>",
