The candidate gene ENSG00000158290 corresponds to CUL4B gene 2. From the OMIM database, I found that CUL4B is associated with \"Intellectual developmental disorder, X-linked syndromic, Cabezas type\" 3. The OMIM ID for this disease is 300304.0 The patient has these phenotypes: HP:0001276, HP:0001270, HP:0002378, HP:0000750, HP:0001263 While I couldn't get the specific phenotype descriptions to match with the disease, the direct gene-disease association from OMIM is sufficient to make the diagnosis. CUL4B is known to be associated with Intellectual developmental disorder, X-linked syndromic, Cabezas type. Let me provide the solution in the required format.</think> <solution> {'disease_name': 'Intellectual developmental disorder, X-linked syndromic, Cabezas type', 'OMIM_ID': '300304'} </solution>",
