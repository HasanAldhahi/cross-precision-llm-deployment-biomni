From the literature search, I found that NALCN is associated with: 1. Congenital contractures of the limbs and face, hypotonia, and developmental delay (CLIFAHDD syndrome) 2. Hypotonia, infantile, with psychomotor retardation and characteristic facies 1 (IHPRF1) The patient's phenotypes match very well with CLIFAHDD syndrome - they have multiple contractures (elbow flexion contracture, knee flexion contracture, hip contracture, flexion contracture), abnormal midface morphology, motor delay, and other features consistent with this syndrome. Since NALCN is the gene associated with CLIFAHDD syndrome and the patient's phenotypes match this syndrome, ENSG00000102452 (NALCN) is the likely causal gene. Let me provide the final answer in the required format.</think> <solution> The likely causal gene for the given phenotype is ENSG00000102452. </solution>",
