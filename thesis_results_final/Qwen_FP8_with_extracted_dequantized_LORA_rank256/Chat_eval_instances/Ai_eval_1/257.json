[✓] Load and interpret the HPO phenotype terms to understand the patient's symptoms 2. [✓] Convert the candidate gene ID to a gene symbol (NALCN) and find associated diseases 3. [✓] Query OMIM database to find diseases associated with the candidate gene 4. [✓] Check literature and compare patient phenotypes with known disease phenotypes 5. [✓] Match the patient's phenotypes with known disease phenotypes to identify the most likely diagnosis 6. [✓] Return the disease name and OMIM ID in the required format The patient's phenotypes strongly match CLIFAHDD syndrome (Congenital Contractures of the Limbs and Face, Hypotonia, And Developmental Delay), which is associated with the NALCN gene and has OMIM ID 616266. <solution> {'disease_name': 'Congenital contractures of the limbs and face, hypotonia, and developmental delay', 'OMIM_ID': 616266} </solution>",
