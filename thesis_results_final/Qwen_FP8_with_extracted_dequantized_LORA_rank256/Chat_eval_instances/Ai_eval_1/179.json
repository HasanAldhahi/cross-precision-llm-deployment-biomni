Let me summarize what I found: 1. The patient has phenotypes that include both bleeding disorders and developmental delay 2. From the OMIM data and literature search, I found that: - FMR1 (ENSG00000102081) is associated with Fragile X syndrome, which includes both developmental delay/intellectual disability and bleeding disorders - COL11A2 (ENSG00000204248) is associated with developmental delay but mainly causes skeletal disorders - C1QA (ENSG00000173372) is associated with bleeding disorders but not developmental delay - PHF6 (ENSG00000156531) is associated with developmental disorders but not bleeding disorders - Other genes (HOXB9, LHX3, VPS13C, RNPS1) show limited or no association with the key phenotypes The patient's phenotype profile includes both bleeding disorders and developmental delay, and FMR1 is the only gene that shows associations with both of these phenotype categories. Fragile X syndrome caused by FMR1 mutations is known to include both developmental delay/intellectual disability and bleeding disorders due to complement and coagulation cascade issues. Therefore, the causal gene is ENSG00000102081 (FMR1).</think> <solution> {'causal_gene': ['ENSG00000102081']} </solution>",
