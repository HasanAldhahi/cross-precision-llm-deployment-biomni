The other genes (IL4R, IL15RA, etc.) showed stronger associations with other immune diseases like sinusitis and asthma, not T-cell lymphoma 4. IL2RA has the strongest biological plausibility for T-cell lymphoma among the candidates The evidence clearly points to IL2RA as the causal gene for T-Cell Lymphoma.</think> Based on my comprehensive analysis of literature and database searches, I've identified the most likely causal gene for T-Cell Lymphoma from the given locus. **Plan Update:** 1. [✓] Searched literature for lymphoma and each gene in the locus 2. [✓] Queried GWAS catalog for associations between genes and lymphoma 3. [✓] Checked OpenTargets for disease associations 4. [✓] Analyzed gene functions and pathways related to lymphoma 5. [✓] Determined the most likely causal gene based on evidence **Key Evidence:** - **IL2RA (CD25)** showed direct associations with T-cell lymphoma in multiple studies - IL2RA is the interleukin-2 receptor alpha chain, crucial for T-cell proliferation and function - Literature shows IL2RA/CD25 is used as a target for lymphoma treatments (camidanlumab tesirine specifically targets CD25+ lymphoma cells) - Other genes showed stronger associations with different immune diseases (sinusitis, asthma) rather than T-cell lymphoma <solution> {\"causal_gene\": [\"IL2RA\"]} </solution>",
