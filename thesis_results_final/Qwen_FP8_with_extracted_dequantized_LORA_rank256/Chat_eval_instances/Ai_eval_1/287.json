From the transcription factor targets data, I discovered an entry with systematicName 'DYRK1A_TARGET_GENES' which contains RAMAC in its geneSymbols list. The other genes (AGAP1, GRIN3B, MACROD1) are not listed as targets in the DYRK1A_TARGET_GENES entry. **Plan:** 1. [✓] Load the GTRD/MSigDB transcription factor targets data 2. [✓] Search for DYRK1A related entries in the data 3. [✓] Check which of the given options are in the DYRK1A target genes 4. [✓] Verify the binding site location is within the promoter region 5.
