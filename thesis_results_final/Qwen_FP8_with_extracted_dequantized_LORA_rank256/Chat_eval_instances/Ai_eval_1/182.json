Strong phenotypic overlap with alpha-mannosidosis 2. Presence of characteristic features like macroglossia, hearing impairment, and skeletal dysplasia 3. Multisystem involvement consistent with lysosomal storage disorders Causal gene identified: ENSG00000104774 (MAN2B1) </observation> [48] ASSISTANT: <think>Based on my analysis, I have identified that the patient's phenotypes strongly match alpha-mannosidosis, which is caused by mutations in the MAN2B1 gene (ENSG00000104774). The patient exhibits multiple characteristic features of alpha-mannosidosis including: 1. Macroglossia (large tongue) - a classic feature 2. Hearing impairment - commonly seen in this condition 3. Intellectual disability and global developmental delay 4. Skeletal dysplasia and delayed skeletal maturation 5. Craniofacial abnormalities (narrow palate, craniofacial hyperostosis, abnormal facial shape) 6. Organomegaly (hepatomegaly, splenomegaly) 7. Other features like dental malocclusion, open bite, and abnormal helix morphology The gene MAN2B1 (ENSG00000104774) is the only one that shows this comprehensive overlap with the patient's phenotype profile. Alpha-mannosidosis is a lysosomal storage disorder that causes progressive multisystem disease, which matches the patient's presentation perfectly. The causal gene is ENSG00000104774.</think> <solution> {'causal_gene': ['ENSG00000104774']} </solution>",
