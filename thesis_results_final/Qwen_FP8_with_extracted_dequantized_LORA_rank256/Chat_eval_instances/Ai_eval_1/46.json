  "prompt": "Your task is to identify the gene with the strongest perturbation effect for the following research context:\n\nI hope to study how the exposure of HeLa cells to Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and IFNgamma influences their susceptibility to bacterial infection over a 48-hour period. This could provide insights into the interplay between bacterial pathogens and immune responses in cervical adenocarcinoma cells.\n\nFrom the following list of candidate genes, select the ONE gene that would have the strongest perturbation effect in this experimental context:\n\nCandidate genes: MT4, OR5C1, RPS6KB1, SMARCA4, TRAPPC1, TAAR9, ADH4, GLP1R, LMO2, STARD9, STAT1\n\nOutput only the gene symbol of your choice, e.g., BRCA1",
