[✓] Query GWAS Catalog for schizophrenia-associated genes and variants (completed) 2. [✓] Check each gene (ANKRD1, HTR7, PCGF5, RPP30) individually for schizophrenia associations (completed) 3. [✓] Review literature for biological evidence linking each gene to schizophrenia (completed) 4. [✓] Analyze the functional relevance of each gene to schizophrenia pathophysiology (completed) 5. [✓] Determine the most likely causal gene based on evidence (completed) Based on my comprehensive analysis, I have found that HTR7 (Serotonin Receptor 7) demonstrates the strongest evidence for causal involvement in schizophrenia. The literature search revealed multiple studies showing direct associations between HTR7 genetic variants and schizophrenia treatment outcomes, including: - Association with risperidone response in Chinese schizophrenia patients - Association with second-generation antipsychotics response in Japanese patients - Genetic polymorphisms affecting clozapine treatment symptoms - Biological relevance through serotonin signaling, which is central to schizophrenia pathophysiology In contrast, the other genes (ANKRD1, PCGF5, RPP30) showed limited or no direct associations with schizophrenia in the literature. HTR7's well-established role in serotonin signaling and its multiple pharmacogenetic associations with antipsychotic treatment outcomes make it the most likely causal gene in this locus. <solution> {HTR7} </solution>",
