[✓] Select the most relevant gene based on the analysis From my research, I found that **RNF214** stands out as having the most direct impact on viral replication mechanisms. The literature specifically identifies RNF214 as a virus restriction factor in mammals that plays a crucial role in innate antiviral immunity. This gene would have the strongest perturbation effect because: 1. **Direct antiviral activity**: RNF214 is specifically identified as a virus restriction factor 2. **Mechanism relevance**: It directly impacts viral replication and could affect the virus's ability to manipulate host cellular machinery 3. **Experimental context fit**: In a study examining viral replication and PRF, perturbing a virus restriction factor like RNF214 would have the most dramatic effect on viral replication outcomes While other genes like REL (NF-kappa-B transcription factor) are also involved in immune responses, RNF214 appears to be more directly mechanistically linked to viral replication control. <solution>RNF214</solution>",

XPO1 (chromosome region maintenance 1) is part of the nuclear pore complex and plays a crucial role in nuclear export of proteins, including genome maintenance regulators that drive chemotherapy resistance in aggressive lymphomas. Among the candidate genes, **NPIPB12** stands out as having the strongest biological relevance because: 1. **Direct pathway involvement**: NPIPB12 is a nuclear pore complex interacting protein, placing it directly in the same cellular machinery that selinexor targets 2. **XPO1 connection**: Since selinexor specifically inhibits XPO1 (CRM1), and NPIPB12 interacts with the nuclear pore complex, perturbation of NPIPB12 would directly affect the nuclear export pathway that selinexor targets 3. **Drug resistance mechanism**: The literature shows that XPO1-mediated mRNA export drives chemotherapy resistance, making components of the nuclear pore complex highly relevant to understanding selinexor resistance Other candidates like ETS1 (transcription factor) and IRF8 (interferon regulatory factor) have more indirect connections to drug resistance mechanisms, while genes like C5 (complement component) and CLCN1 (chloride channel) have even weaker biological connections to selinexor's mechanism of action. <solution>NPIPB12</solution>",

[✓] Investigate each gene individually for known functions and disease associations 4. [✓] Cross-reference with genetic disorder databases (OMIM, DisGeNET) for glaucoma associations 5. [✓] Identify the most likely causal gene based on evidence Based on my comprehensive analysis of the GWAS catalog and literature, I found that among the 12 genes in the locus, **GAS7** is the only gene that shows direct associations with primary open angle glaucoma and related traits: **Key findings:** - GAS7 shows multiple associations with \"primary open angle glaucoma (multi-trait analysis)\" with extremely significant p-values (as low as 6×10⁻⁸³) - GAS7 also shows associations with \"intraocular pressure\" (p-values as low as 2×10⁻⁵⁸) - GAS7 encodes Growth Arrest-Specific Protein 7, which is involved in cell cycle regulation and has been identified in multiple glaucoma GWAS studies - No other genes from the locus showed direct associations with glaucoma or related phenotypes <solution>GAS7</solution>",
