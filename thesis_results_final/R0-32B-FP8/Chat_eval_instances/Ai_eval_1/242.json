[✓] Provide the final answer **Evidence Summary:** From the systematic review of literature and database searches, IL2RA (Interleukin 2 Receptor Alpha) shows the strongest evidence for being the causal gene for lymphoma: - **GWAS Catalog**: IL2RA was found to have direct associations with lymphoma - **Literature Evidence**: Multiple studies directly link IL2RA to lymphoma pathogenesis, including research on adult T-cell leukemia and lymphoma treatments targeting the IL-2R pathway - **Biological Function**: IL2RA encodes the alpha subunit of the interleukin-2 receptor, which is critical for T cell activation and immune response - directly relevant to lymphoma development - **Pathogenesis Role**: IL-2R signaling pathway is well-established in lymphoma biology and immune system dysregulation The other genes showed minimal or no direct lymphoma associations: - ANKRD16: Only found in neurological studies, no lymphoma connection - PRKCQ: Found in immune-related studies but not specifically lymphoma - IL15RA: Some immune-related studies but less direct lymphoma connection - Others: No significant lymphoma associations found <solution>IL2RA</execute></solution>",
