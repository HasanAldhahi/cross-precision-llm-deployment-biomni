Direct associations with both L-Acetylcarnitine and Hexanoylcarnitine phenotypes\n2. Exceptionally strong statistical significance (P-value = 2×10⁻¹⁷² for the metabolic ratio)\n3. Biologically plausible mechanism through carnitine transport pathway\n4. Validation across multiple technical platforms (Metabolon, Biocrates)\n\n## Recommendation\nPrioritize rs4949874 for functional studies and replication in targeted cohorts examining carnitine metabolism pathways.",
