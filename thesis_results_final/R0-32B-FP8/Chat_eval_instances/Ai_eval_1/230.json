Gene functions and biological pathways were analyzed to determine mechanistic relevance to liver cancer pathogenesis.\n\n## Key Findings\n\n### Primary Candidate: VEGFA\n\n**Gene Function:** Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A - a critical regulator of angiogenesis and tumor vascularization\n\n**Supporting Evidence:**\n- Multiple direct associations with hepatocellular carcinoma [1]\n- Central role in tumor vascularization and angiogenesis [2]\n- Functions as an oncogene promoting cancer progression [3]\n- Specific papers link VEGFA signaling pathways to liver cancer treatment and prognosis [4]\n\n### Secondary Candidates\n\n**GNMT (Glycine N-Methyltransferase):**\n- Associated with liver cancer in HCV and HBV contexts\n- Functions as potential tumor suppressor\n- Involved in liver cancer diagnosis and prognosis\n\n**CUL7 (Cullin 7):**\n- Associated with hepatocellular carcinoma progression\n- Involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition mechanisms\n- Functions as oncogene in liver cancer\n\n### Other Genes in Locus\n\nAdditional genes including CUL9, POLH, and SRF showed weaker or less direct associations with liver neoplasms, primarily through related pathways rather than direct cancer mechanisms.\n\n## Biological Rationale\n\nVEGFA demonstrates the strongest biologic plausibility as the causal gene because:\n\n1. **Direct mechanistic involvement**: Angiogenesis is fundamental to liver tumor growth and progression\n2. **Established oncogene function**: VEGFA is well-documented as promoting cancer development\n3. **Liver-specific relevance**: Literature consistently links VEGFA to hepatocellular carcinoma\n4. **Pathway centrality**: Controls tumor vascularization, enabling nutrient supply and metastasis\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**Likely Causal Gene: VEGFA**\n\nVEGFA represents the most compelling candidate based on convergent evidence from literature analysis, biological function, and mechanistic relevance to liver neoplasm pathogenesis.\n\n## References\n\n[1] Multiple studies documenting VEGFA associations with hepatocellular carcinoma progression  \n[2] Research demonstrating VEGFA's role in tumor vascularization and angiogenesis pathways  \n[3] Clinical studies identifying VEGFA as an oncogene in liver cancer contexts  \n[4] Papers exploring VEGFA signaling in liver cancer treatment and diagnostic applications",
