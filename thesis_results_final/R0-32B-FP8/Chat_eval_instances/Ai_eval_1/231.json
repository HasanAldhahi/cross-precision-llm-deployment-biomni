Direct experimental demonstration of hepatocellular carcinoma induction\n2. Protooncogene classification with known cancer biology mechanisms\n3. Consistent pattern of oncogenic activity across multiple literature sources\n\n---\n\n**References:**\n[1] Experimental evidence from Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PMID: 41196356)\n[2] Association with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis from Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences (PMID: 39888429)",
