This pathway involves:\n- Assembly of hexameric IL-6 receptor complexes\n- STAT1/STAT3 activation and ERK1/2 phosphorylation\n- Inflammatory mediator production via NF-kappaB and MAPK pathways [3]\n\n### Clinical Validation\nTocilizumab, an IL-6 receptor antagonist that directly targets IL6R, is FDA-approved for treating rheumatoid arthritis, providing clinical validation of its role in disease pathogenesis [4].\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**IL6R** is the most likely causal gene for rheumatoid arthritis in this locus, supported by:\n- Consistent statistical associations across multiple GWAS studies\n- Direct mechanistic involvement in RA pathogenesis through IL-6 signaling\n- Established clinical relevance as a therapeutic target\n- Extensive literature supporting its role in disease mechanisms\n\n## References\n\n[1] GWAS Catalog evidence showing IL6R as a susceptibility locus for rheumatoid arthritis with genome-wide significant p-values across different populations and study designs.\n\n[2] Literature evidence demonstrating IL6R's involvement in rheumatoid arthritis treatment and pathogenesis, including studies on tocilizumab biosimilars, treatment response biomarkers, and IL-6 signaling mechanisms.\n\n[3] Reactome pathway analysis showing IL6R's role in IL-6 signaling, including receptor assembly and downstream signaling cascades crucial for inflammatory responses.\n\n[4] Clinical evidence with tocilizumab (CT-P47), an IL-6 receptor antagonist targeting IL6R, being FDA-approved for rheumatoid arthritis treatment based on extensive clinical trials.",
