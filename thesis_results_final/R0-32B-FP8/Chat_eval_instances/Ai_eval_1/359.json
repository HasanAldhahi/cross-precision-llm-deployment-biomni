It serves as an important biomarker for blood coagulation processes and thrombotic events. The task was to identify the most likely causal gene for D-dimer levels from a locus containing 13 candidate genes.\n\n## Methods\n\nA systematic literature search was conducted using PubMed to evaluate each gene's biological connection to blood coagulation and D-dimer levels. The search focused on:\n- Direct associations with blood coagulation pathways\n- Known roles in thrombosis or clot formation\n- Specific connections to D-dimer levels\n- Functional relevance to the coagulation cascade\n\n## Key Findings\n\n### F5 Gene (Coagulation Factor V)\nThe F5 gene showed the strongest evidence for being the causal gene:\n\n- **Direct D-dimer associations**: Multiple studies demonstrate F5 gene variants are associated with D-dimer levels in breast cancer patients and healthy adults [1,2]\n- **Clinical significance**: Factor V Leiden mutations (F5 variants) are well-established thrombophilia mutations associated with increased clotting risk [3]\n- **Functional relevance**: F5 encodes Factor V, a crucial component of the blood coagulation cascade that is essential for fibrin clot formation - the precursor to D-dimer production [4]\n- **Geographic associations**: Studies show F5 mutations confer genetic susceptibility to cerebral venous and sinus thrombosis in specific populations [5]\n\n### Other Candidate Genes\n\n**SELP** (P-selectin): Some evidence for involvement in platelet-endothelium interactions and immune-coagulation dynamics, but less direct connection to the core coagulation cascade.\n\n**BLZF1**: Located on chromosome 1q24, associated with venous thromboembolism in some GWAS studies, but primarily involved in immune regulation.\n\n**SELE, SELL**: Selectin genes with limited evidence for direct coagulation involvement.\n\n**Remaining genes** (ATP1B1, C1orf112, CCDC181, KIFAP3, METTL18, NME7, SCYL3, SLC19A2): No clear biological connections to blood coagulation or D-dimer production identified.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**F5** is the most likely causal gene for D-dimer levels in this locus based on:\n1. Direct functional role in blood coagulation\n2. Established associations with D-dimer levels\n3. Clinical relevance of Factor V mutations\n4. Essential position in the coagulation cascade that produces fibrin clots (D-dimer precursors)\n\n## References\n\n[1] \"Genetic predictors of fibrin D-dimer levels in healthy adults\" - Circulation\n[2] \"A genetic association study of D-dimer levels with 50K SNPs from a candidate gene chip\" - Thrombosis Research  \n[3] \"Clinical, Molecular, and Bioinformatic Study of Common Thrombophilia Mutation Factor V Leiden\" - Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology\n[4] \"Population-Based Genetic Assessment of Thrombophilia Polymorphisms\" - Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)\n[5] \"Association of the Coagulation Factor V c.3865T>G Mutation with Genetic and Regional Susceptibility to Cerebral Venous and Sinus Thrombosis\" - Vascular Health and Risk Management",
