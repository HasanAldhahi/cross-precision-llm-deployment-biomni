Superior statistical evidence (4 significant associations vs 2 for BANK1)\n2. Extremely low P-values indicating strong genetic association\n3. Robust biological mechanism through zinc/manganese transport affecting brain development\n4. Literature support for roles in brain volume regulation and neurological traits\n5. Direct mention in studies about brain nuclei volume (PMID: 37391117)\n\nThis analysis provides clear evidence pointing to SLC39A8 as the primary candidate gene influencing medial nucleus volume through its essential role in brain metal homeostasis and neurological development.",
