This encompasses UVB-induced skin damage, hyperpigmentation, tanning responses, and other photodamaging effects caused by chronic UV exposure.\n\n## Methodology\n\n1. **Phenotype characterization**: Systematic literature review of skin changes from chronic nonionizing radiation exposure\n2. **GWAS catalog search**: Query for existing associations with this phenotype\n3. **Gene function analysis**: Functional annotation of 21 genes within the locus\n4. **Literature-based prioritization**: Assessment of each gene's biological relevance to UV radiation response\n\n## Key Findings\n\n### Primary Candidate: MC1R (Melanocortin-1 Receptor)\n\n**MC1R** demonstrated the strongest biological evidence for causality [1,2,3]:\n\n- **Direct mechanistic role**: Controls melanin synthesis in melanocytes through the melanocortin-1 receptor pathway\n- **UV response regulation**: Multiple studies demonstrate MC1R variants affect UVB-induced skin damage and hyperpigmentation\n- **Protective function**: Plays a protective role in chromosome stability and DNA repair in melanocytes exposed to UV radiation\n- **Pigmentation control**: Loss-of-function mutations in MC1R are associated with coat color variation in mammals\n- **Clinical relevance**: Germline MC1R variants affect melanoma susceptibility and immune checkpoint inhibitor efficacy\n\n### Secondary Candidates\n\n**FANCA**: Involved in DNA repair through the Fanconi anemia pathway and melanoma susceptibility, but represents general DNA repair mechanisms rather than skin-specific UV response [4].\n\n**CDK10**: Identified in melanoma research contexts, primarily related to cancer progression and radioresistance mechanisms, not direct pigmentation responses [5].\n\n**SPG7**: Mentioned in melanoma therapeutic target studies, but lacks clear UV radiation sensitivity connections [6].\n\n### Other Genes\n\nThe remaining 17 genes (ANKRD11, CHMP1A, CPNE7, DBNDD1, DEF8, DPEP1, ENSG00000198211, GAS8, PRDM7, RPL13, SPATA2L, SPATA33, TCF25, TUBB3, VPS9D1, ZNF276) showed no clear associations with skin radiation sensitivity or UV response mechanisms.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**MC1R** is the most biologically plausible causal gene for skin changes due to chronic exposure to nonionizing radiation, based on its direct role in controlling skin pigmentation, UV radiation response, and melanocyte DNA repair mechanisms.\n\n## References\n\n[1] Multiple studies demonstrating MC1R's role in UVB-induced skin damage and hyperpigmentation  \n[2] Evidence showing MC1R variants affect skin pigmentation and UV response  \n[3] Research demonstrating MC1R's protective role in melanocyte chromosome stability and DNA repair  \n[4] FANCA involvement in Fanconi anemia pathway and melanoma susceptibility  \n[5] CDK10 studies in melanoma progression and radioresistance  \n[6] SPG7 identification in melanoma therapeutic target research",
