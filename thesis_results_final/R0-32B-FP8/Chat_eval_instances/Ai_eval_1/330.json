V56E**\n\nThe V56E variant stands out as the only option with a confirmed pathogenic classification in ClinVar, specifically in the PRKN gene which is clinically significant for neurodegenerative diseases. The other variants (Q34R, V380L) show benign classifications, while A46T lacks ClinVar documentation entirely.",
