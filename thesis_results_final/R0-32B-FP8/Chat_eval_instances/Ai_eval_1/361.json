Querying GWAS Catalog for Type 2 diabetes associations\n2. Searching PubMed literature for diabetes-related gene associations\n3. Cross-referencing with DisGeNET gene-disease association database\n4. Evaluating functional relevance to glucose metabolism\n\n## Key Findings\n\n### GCKR - Primary Candidate\n- **Database Evidence**: Found in 7 distinct diabetes-related disorders in DisGeNET\n- **Literature Support**: Multiple publications specifically linking GCKR to diabetes mellitus [1]\n- **Functional Relevance**: Encodes glucokinase regulatory protein, which controls glucokinase - the key enzyme regulating glucose entry into metabolic pathways\n- **Clinical Relevance**: GCKR variants associated with metabolic dysfunction and identified as a putative target for gestational diabetes mellitus\n\n### Secondary Candidates\n- **CAD**: Found in 3 diabetes-related disorders, primarily cardiovascular complications rather than direct diabetes causation\n- **SLC30A3**: Found in 1 diabetes-related disorder (zinc transport and insulin function)\n- **UCN**: Found in 1 diabetes-related disorder (metabolic regulation)\n\n## Evidence Summary\n\n### GCKR Literature Highlights\n- \"Genetic Variations in GCKR and PNPLA3 Regulate Metabolic Balance Across the Liver\" [2]\n- \"Glucokinase Regulatory Protein as a Putative Target for Gestational Diabetes Mellitus and Related Complications\" [3]\n- \"Impaired GK-GKRP interaction rather than direct GK activation worsens lipid profiles and contributes to long-term complications\" [4]\n- \"Identification and characterization of a FOXA2-regulated transcriptional enhancer at a type 2 diabetes intronic locus that controls GCKR expression in liver cells\" [5]\n\n### Comparative Analysis\nGCKR demonstrates superior evidence across all assessment categories:\n- **Frequency**: Most frequent appearance in diabetes-related disorders (7 vs 3-1 for other genes)\n- **Specificity**: Literature specifically links GCKR to Type 2 diabetes pathogenesis\n- **Mechanism**: Direct functional involvement in glucose metabolism regulation\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**GCKR** is the most likely causal gene for Type 2 diabetes in this locus, supported by robust database associations, extensive literature evidence, and direct functional relevance to glucose metabolism.\n\n---\n\n**References:**\n[1] Multiple PubMed papers (PMID: 40748365, 39921581, 38951793, 28683826, 26515422)\n[2] *Diabetes* journal, PMID: 40272879\n[3] *Journal of Diabetes* and *Cardiovascular Diabetology* papers\n[4] Mendelian randomization studies showing metabolic impact\n[5] *Genome Medicine* paper on transcriptional regulation",
