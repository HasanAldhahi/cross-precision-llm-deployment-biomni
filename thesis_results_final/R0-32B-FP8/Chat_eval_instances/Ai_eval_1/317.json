The dataset contains 6,831,595 entries with miRNA-target predictions.\n\n## Key Findings\n\n### miRNA Identification\n- MIR3190_3P corresponds to \"hsa-miR-3190-3p\" in the miRDB v6.0 database\n- This miRNA has **1,406 computationally predicted human gene targets** in total\n\n### Target Gene Analysis\nFrom the provided options, I found:\n\n| Option | Target Status | Prediction Score |\n|--------|---------------|------------------|\n| ZFPL1 | ❌ Not found | - |\n| AMMECR1 | ✅ Found | 63.3439 |\n| SERTAD3 | ✅ Found | 73.7585 |\n| CIMAP1B | ❌ Not found | - |\n\n### Evidence Summary\n- **AMMECR1** appears in the miRDB v6.0 results with a prediction score of 63.3439 [1]\n- **SERTAD3** appears in the miRDB v6.0 results with a prediction score of 73.7585 [2]\n- The 5p variant (MIR3190_5P) does not contain the same target genes for this query\n\n## Answer Justification\n\nBoth AMMECR1 and SERTAD3 are computationally predicted targets of MIR3190_3P in miRDB v6.0. However, **SERTAD3 has the higher prediction score** (73.76 vs 63.34), indicating greater computational confidence in this interaction.\n\n**Answer: C.
