[✓] Match patient's phenotype profile to disease associations to identify causal gene Based on my analysis, the patient has a comprehensive phenotype profile that strongly matches Chediak-Higashi syndrome, which is caused by mutations in the LYST gene (ENSG00000143669). The patient's phenotypes include: - Pigmentation abnormalities: Generalized hyperpigmentation, white hair, partial albinism, hypopigmentation of the skin - Bleeding disorders: Gingival bleeding, bruising susceptibility, thrombocytopenia, anemia - Neurological features: Global developmental delay, cerebellar atrophy, peripheral neuropathy - Immune defects: Immunodeficiency, recurrent respiratory infections, lymphadenopathy - Other features: Hepatomegaly, skin rash, brittle hair This constellation of features is highly characteristic of Chediak-Higashi syndrome, which is caused by mutations in the LYST gene. The other candidate genes do not show this comprehensive overlap with the patient's phenotype profile. The answer should be: {'causal_gene': ['ENSG00000143669']}</think> I need to provide the final solution in the required JSON format. <solution> {'causal_gene': ['ENSG00000143669']} </solution>",
