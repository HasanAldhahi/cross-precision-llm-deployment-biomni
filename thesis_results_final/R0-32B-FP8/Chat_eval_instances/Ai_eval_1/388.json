The etiology involves complex genetic factors affecting vascular development and maintenance.\n\n## Methodology\n\n1. **Disease Literature Analysis**: Systematic search of PubMed literature for Moyamoya disease genetics and associated genes\n2. **Gene Function Analysis**: Evaluation of transcription factor target datasets to understand gene regulation\n3. **Disease Association Cross-referencing**: Comparison of candidate genes with known Moyamoya disease associations\n4. **Biological Evidence Synthesis**: Integration of multiple data sources to identify the most likely causal gene\n\n## Key Findings\n\n### Transcription Factor Analysis\n- Examined SETD7 transcription factor target dataset containing 9,889 target genes\n- Only **EIF4A3** from the candidate locus showed SETD7 binding site in its promoter region\n- This regulatory relationship is unlikely to be directly causal for Moyamoya disease\n\n### Literature Evidence\n- Multiple literature searches consistently identified **RNF213** as associated with Moyamoya disease\n- RNF213 appeared prominently in Moyamoya disease genetic association studies\n- Other candidate genes showed minimal or no direct association with Moyamoya disease in literature searches\n\n### Established Genetic Knowledge\n- RNF213 encodes a ring finger protein involved in DNA repair and vascular development\n- Well-documented as a major genetic cause of Moyamoya disease through multiple independent studies\n- Functions in cerebrovascular development pathways relevant to Moyamoya pathogenesis\n\n### Candidate Gene Assessment\nAmong the 12 candidate genes analyzed:\n- **RNF213**: Strong literature evidence for Moyamoya disease association ✓\n- **EIF4A3**: SETD7 regulatory relationship but no known Moyamoya association ✗\n- **Other genes**: No significant associations with Moyamoya disease found ✗\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**RNF213** is identified as the most likely causal gene for Moyamoya disease within this locus based on:\n\n1. Consistent literature evidence showing direct association with Moyamoya disease\n2. Established biological function relevant to cerebrovascular development\n3. Multiple independent genetic studies confirming its role as a major susceptibility gene\n4. Absence of comparable evidence for other candidate genes\n\n## References\n\n- PubMed literature searches for Moyamoya disease genetics\n- Transcription factor target database analysis (SETD7 targets)\n- Known genetic associations from cerebrovascular disease studies\n- OMIM database disease gene associations for Moyamoya disease\n\n---\n\n*Analysis conducted using systematic approach combining literature evidence, transcription factor databases, and established genetic knowledge for Moyamoya disease pathogenesis.*",
