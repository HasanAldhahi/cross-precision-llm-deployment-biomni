The core ferroptosis pathway involves:\n**ML-210 → GPX4 degradation → lipid peroxidation → cell death**\n\n## Candidate Gene Analysis\n\n**ACSL4** (Long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase 4):\n- Directly catalyzes fatty acid activation to acyl-CoA for cellular lipid metabolism\n- Central to lipid peroxidation processes that drive ferroptosis\n- Literature evidence shows involvement in ferroptosis pathways and cancer progression\n- Most directly relevant to the cellular response to ML-210 treatment\n\n**CRIP2** (Cysteine-rich protein 2):\n- Involved in general cellular processes and stress responses\n- Less direct connection to ferroptosis mechanisms\n- Moderate relevance to cellular stress but not lipid metabolism\n\n**SLC9A8** (Sodium/hydrogen exchanger):\n- Regulates cellular pH and iron homeostasis\n- Could affect ferroptosis through pH-dependent mechanisms\n- Moderate relevance to ferroptosis but indirect pathway involvement\n\n**HOXB7** (Homeobox protein B7):\n- Transcription factor involved in cancer progression\n- Could regulate ferroptosis-related genes through transcriptional control\n- Moderate relevance to cancer context but indirect ferroptosis involvement\n\n**Other Candidates** (TBC1D9, MARVELD2, CALCR, ENY2, COCH, RYR1):\n- Limited direct connections to ferroptosis or lipid metabolism pathways\n- Lower relevance to ML-210-induced ferroptosis mechanisms\n\n## Key Findings\n\n1. **Direct Mechanistic Relevance**: ACSL4 is directly involved in fatty acid metabolism, which is the core cellular process disrupted by ML-210-induced ferroptosis.\n\n2. **Literature Evidence**: Multiple studies demonstrate ACSL4's role in ferroptosis pathways and cancer progression, confirming its biological significance.\n\n3. **Pathway Integration**: Perturbation of ACSL4 would directly impact lipid peroxidation processes, making it the most relevant target for studying ML-210's effects.\n\n4. **Cell Line Relevance**: The mechanism is particularly relevant to 786-O renal cell carcinoma cells, where lipid metabolism and ferroptosis pathways are key therapeutic targets.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**ACSL4** represents the optimal gene selection for this experimental context due to its direct involvement in lipid metabolism pathways that are central to ML-210-induced ferroptosis. Perturbation of this gene would provide the strongest insights into cellular response mechanisms and potential susceptibility to ferroptosis in the 786-O renal cell carcinoma model.\n\n---\n\nThis analysis was conducted using comprehensive literature review from PubMed, database queries from UniProt, and GWAS catalog analysis to evaluate each candidate gene's functional relevance to ferroptosis and cancer biology.",
