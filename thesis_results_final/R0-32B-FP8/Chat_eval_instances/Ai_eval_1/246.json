Looking at the pattern of phenotypes (joint contractures, ophthalmoplegia, ptosis, scoliosis), this matches well with Marden-Walker syndrome, which is also known as \"Arthrogryposis, distal, type 3\" and has OMIM ID 114300. Let me provide the final diagnosis.</think> Based on my analysis of the patient's phenotypes and the candidate gene: **Plan Update:** 1. [✓] Look up the meaning of the HP phenotype codes 2. [✓] Identify the candidate gene (ENSG00000154864 = PIEZO2) 3. [✓] Search for diseases associated with these phenotypes and the PIEZO2 gene 4. [✓] Find the specific disease and its OMIM ID 5. [✓] Format the output as requested The patient presents with: - Joint contractures of the hand (HP:0009473) - Flexion contractures (HP:0001371) - Ophthalmoplegia (HP:0000602) - Scoliosis (HP:0002650) - Ptosis (HP:0000508) The candidate gene ENSG00000154864 corresponds to PIEZO2. From the OMIM database, PIEZO2 mutations are associated with several arthrogryposis conditions, but the specific combination of distal arthrogryposis, ophthalmoplegia, ptosis, and scoliosis in this patient strongly indicates Marden-Walker syndrome. <solution> {\"disease_name\": \"Marden-Walker syndrome\", \"OMIM_ID\": \"114300\"} </solution>",
