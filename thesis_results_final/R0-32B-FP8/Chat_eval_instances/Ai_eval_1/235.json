Highest frequency of ovarian cancer associations across databases\n2. Direct mutation-based evidence in ovarian carcinoma subtypes\n3. Fundamental role in DNA processes that drive genomic instability\n4. Established cancer driver status with documented clinical relevance\n\n---\n\n**References:**\n[1] DisGeNET database analysis showing TOP2A associations with multiple ovarian cancer phenotypes\n[2] PubMed literature demonstrating direct involvement of TOP2A mutations in high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma",
