The biological connection can be established through:\n\n1. **Direct metabolic pathway involvement**: SUCLG2 directly metabolizes succinate, the core component of succinylcarnitine\n2. **Enzymatic specificity**: SUCLG2 binds succinate as part of its catalytic mechanism\n3. **Metabolic network position**: SUCLG2 operates in the citric acid cycle, a central metabolic pathway\n\n## Evidence Summary\n\n### Supporting SUCLG2 as Causal Gene:\n- Direct enzymatic role in succinate metabolism ✓\n- Beta subunit specifically binds succinate ✓  \n- Located in mitochondrial matrix where succinate metabolism occurs ✓\n- Metabolic enzymes are more likely to affect metabolite levels directly ✓\n\n### Excluding KBTBD8:\n- Involved in transcriptional regulation, not direct metabolite metabolism ✗\n- Functions in protein ubiquitination pathways ✗\n- No direct connection to succinate or carnitine metabolic pathways ✗\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**SUCLG2** is the most likely causal gene for blood metabolite levels of succinylcarnitine based on its direct involvement in succinate metabolism. The enzyme's function in the citric acid cycle and its specific binding to succinate provide a clear biological mechanism for influencing succinylcarnitine levels.\n\n---\n\n**References:**\n[1] UniProt evidence showing SUCLG2's role as succinate-CoA ligase with EC 6.2.1.4, binding succinate and functioning in the TCA cycle\n[2] UniProt evidence showing KBTBD8's role as E3 ubiquitin ligase adapter with no direct metabolic function",
