It causes mucopolysaccharidosis II (Hunter syndrome) 2. The patient's phenotype constellation perfectly matches Hunter syndrome 3. IDS is in the candidate gene list 4. The other candidate genes don't match the full phenotype constellation as well as IDS does 5. Hunter syndrome is known to cause exactly this pattern of multisystem involvement I'll provide the final solution with the causal gene identified as IDS.</think> I'll provide the final answer based on my comprehensive analysis of the patient's phenotype constellation and candidate genes. <solution> {\"causal_gene\": [\"ENSG00000010404\"]} </solution>",
