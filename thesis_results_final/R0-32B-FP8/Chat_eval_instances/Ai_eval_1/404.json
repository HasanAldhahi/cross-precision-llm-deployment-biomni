Direct \"Multi-trait sex score\" associations across all genes in the locus\n2. Broader sex-related trait associations for biological context\n3. Functional annotation of top candidate genes through trait profiling\n\n## Conclusion\n\nCETP emerges as the most likely causal gene for multi-trait sex score based on both statistical evidence (highest association count) and biological plausibility (sex-specific lipid metabolism effects). This finding aligns with established knowledge of CETP's role in metabolic traits that exhibit sexual dimorphism.\n\n**Causal gene candidate: CETP**",
