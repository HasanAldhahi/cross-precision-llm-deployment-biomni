Direct therapeutic targeting by Mogamulizumab\n2. Multiple mechanistic studies demonstrating its role in T-cell lymphoma biology\n3. Fundamental role in T-cell migration and immune signaling\n4. Strong evidence from knockout studies showing suppression of T-cell lymphoma growth\n\n## References\n\n[1] Evidence from multiple studies showing CCR4 knockout suppresses T-cell lymphoma growth and metastasis in canine cutaneous lymphoma models\n\n[2] Clinical evidence for Mogamulizumab, an anti-CCR4 monoclonal antibody specifically approved for treating cutaneous T-cell lymphoma\n\n[3] CCR4 functions as a chemokine receptor that binds CCL17 and CCL22, playing crucial roles in T-cell trafficking and immune cell migration\n\n[4] Studies demonstrating CMTM6's role in shaping antitumor T cell responses through regulation of CD58 and PD-L1 expression\n\n[5] Research showing CMTM7's involvement in chronic inflammatory tumor microenvironments and immunosuppressive biomarkers",
