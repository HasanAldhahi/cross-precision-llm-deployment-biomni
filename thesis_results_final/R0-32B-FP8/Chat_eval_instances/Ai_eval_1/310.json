Accessed MSigDB C6 oncogenic signature gene set data from the biological data lake\n2. Located the specific BRCA1_DN.V1_DN gene set (systematic name: M2747)\n3. Extracted and analyzed the complete list of 1,313 gene symbols contained in this gene set\n4. Cross-referenced each provided option against the gene set\n\n## Key Findings\n\n### Gene Set Characteristics\n- **Gene Set ID**: BRCA1_DN.V1_DN (M2747)\n- **Collection**: MSigDB C6 (Oncogenic Signature Gene Sets)\n- **Source**: Derived from BRCA1 knockdown vs luciferase control knockdown in MCF10A cells\n- **Total Genes**: 1,313 down-regulated genes\n\n### Option Analysis\n| Gene | Status | Found in Gene Set |\n|------|--------|------------------|\n| PPP1R15B | ✗ | Not found |\n| PLEC | ✗ | Not found |\n| **SPATA31A1** | **✓** | **Found** |\n| SSX3 | ✗ | Not found |\n\n## Conclusion\nBased on the empirical analysis of the MSigDB C6 oncogenic signature gene set data, **SPATA31A1** is the only gene from the provided options that is present in the BRCA1_DN.V1_DN gene set [1]. This finding is supported by direct database verification rather than inference or speculation.\n\n**Answer: C.
