Multiple documented associations with sex-related disorders\n2. Strong literature evidence for sex-specific biological effects  \n3. Well-established role in cardiometabolic pathways showing sexual dimorphism\n4. Consistent findings across different genomic databases\n\n---\n\n**References:**\n[1] DisGeNET database analysis showing CETP associations with sex-related disorders including sex reversal, sex differentiation disorders, and cryptogenic sexual precocity\n\n[2] PubMed literature search revealing multiple studies on CETP's sex-specific effects, including sex-dependent cardiovascular risk, sexually dimorphic DNA methylation, and sex-specific effects on perivascular adipose tissue",
