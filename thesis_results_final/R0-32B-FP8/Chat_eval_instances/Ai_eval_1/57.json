By controlling nucleotide availability, it directly influences the cell's capacity to respond to CDK inhibition, which is fundamental to Dinaciclib's mechanism.\n\n**Cell Cycle Disruption**: The enzyme's impact on DNA replication creates a bottleneck that cancer cells must overcome, potentially driving resistance through altered cell cycle dynamics.\n\n**Synergistic Drug Interactions**: DHODH's proven ability to enhance other drug resistance pathways suggests it could be a pivotal gene in Dinaciclib resistance development.\n\n**Apoptosis Regulation**: By affecting DNA damage responses, DHODH inhibition can trigger apoptosis, a key mechanism cancer cells must subvert for drug resistance.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**DHODH** emerges as the gene with the strongest potential perturbation effect in THP-1 monocytic leukemia cells developing Dinaciclib resistance. Its critical role in nucleotide metabolism, direct connections to cancer drug resistance mechanisms, and specific involvement in creating metabolic vulnerabilities make it the most biologically relevant candidate for studying resistance development to CDK inhibitors like Dinaciclib.\n\nThe perturbation of DHODH would fundamentally alter the cellular metabolic landscape, potentially driving the most significant changes in drug resistance mechanisms over the 21-day treatment period.",
