This therapeutic relevance supports TOP2A's causal role in lymphomagenesis.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**TOP2A** emerges as the most likely causal gene for T-Cell Peripheral Lymphoma based on:\n\n1. Direct literature evidence linking TOP2A to peripheral T-cell lymphoma prognosis and treatment\n2. Functional role in DNA replication and cell cycle control - key processes in oncogenesis\n3. Established therapeutic targeting with TOP2A inhibitors in lymphoma treatment\n4. Consistent appearance in lymphoma-related gene sets across multiple databases\n\nWhile CDC6, RARA, and CCR7 showed some associations with lymphoma, TOP2A demonstrates the strongest convergence of evidence for causality in T-cell peripheral lymphoma development.\n\n---\n\n*Analysis conducted using comprehensive biomedical databases including DisGeNET, GWAS Catalog, OMIM, and PubMed literature.*",
