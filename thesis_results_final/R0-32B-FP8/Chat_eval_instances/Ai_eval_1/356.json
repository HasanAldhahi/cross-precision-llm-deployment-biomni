While CYP2E1 can process acetamide groups, PAOX has the most direct enzymatic relationship with the defining structural feature of X-03056.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**PAOX** is the most likely causal gene for blood metabolite levels of X-03056 due to its direct enzymatic processing of the pyrrolidin-2-one ring, representing the primary metabolic pathway for this compound.\n\n---\n\n**References:**\n[1] PAOX encodes pyrrolidone oxidase, which specifically oxidizes pyrrolidin-2-one structures to succinate  \n[2] CYP2E1 is known to metabolize acetamide-containing compounds through cytochrome P450-dependent pathways  \n[3] Literature evidence supports PAOX-mediated oxidation of pyrrolidin-2-one rings in similar metabolite structures",
