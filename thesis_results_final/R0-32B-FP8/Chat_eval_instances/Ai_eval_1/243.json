Among the PIEZO2-related diseases, \"Arthrogryposis, distal, type 5\" (OMIM: 108145) is the most likely diagnosis because: - It's the most common PIEZO2-related disease - The phenotype pattern of joint contractures in hands and feet matches well with distal arthrogryposis - The OMIM ID 108145 was mentioned in the PIEZO2 phenotype associations The patient has phenotypes that include joint contractures of the hand and foot, which are classic features of distal arthrogryposis. Combined with the PIEZO2 gene association, this points to \"Arthrogryposis, distal, type 5\" as the most likely diagnosis. My plan is now complete: 1. [✓] Convert the HP (Human Phenotype Ontology) terms to human-readable descriptions 2. [✓] Identify the candidate gene from the Ensembl ID 3. [✓] Search for rare diseases that are associated with both the phenotypes and the gene 4. [✓] Find the specific disease name and OMIM ID 5. [✓] Format the output as requested JSON The diagnosis is: Arthrogryposis, distal, type 5 with OMIM ID 108145 </think> <solution> {'disease_name': 'Arthrogryposis, distal, type 5', 'OMIM_ID': '108145'} </solution>",
