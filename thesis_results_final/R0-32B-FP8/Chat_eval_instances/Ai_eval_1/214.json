Strong Literature Support\nPPARG demonstrated robust literature evidence with over 900 papers directly linking it to type 2 diabetes pathogenesis and treatment [1].\n\n### 2. Direct Metabolic Function\nPPARG serves as a nuclear receptor transcription factor that:\n- Controls genes involved in glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity\n- Regulates adipogenesis and metabolic syndrome components\n- Has established roles in diabetes mellitus pathogenesis [5]\n\n### 3. Clinical Validation\nPPARG agonists (thiazolidinediones) are FDA-approved medications for type 2 diabetes treatment, providing direct clinical validation of its causal role [4].\n\n### 4. GWAS Evidence\nMultiple GWAS studies demonstrate associations between PPARG gene variants and diabetes risk, confirming its genetic relevance to the phenotype [6].\n\n## Alternative Candidates\n\n### RAF1 Considerations\nWhile RAF1 showed the highest literature count (982 papers), its role is primarily in:\n- MAPK signaling cascade\n- Insulin resistance mechanisms\n- Cellular proliferation pathways\n\nIts diabetes association is more indirect compared to PPARG's direct metabolic control.\n\n### Other Genes\nRemaining genes (MKRN2, MKRN2OS, SYN2, TAMM41, TIMP4, TSEN2, VGLL4) showed minimal literature associations with type 2 diabetes and lack direct functional relevance to diabetes pathogenesis.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**PPARG** represents the most likely causal gene for Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2 within this locus based on:\n- Strongest literature evidence (900+ diabetes-related papers)\n- Direct functional relevance to glucose metabolism and insulin signaling\n- Established therapeutic target status for diabetes treatment\n- Extensive GWAS validation for diabetes risk associations\n\nThe convergence of literature evidence, functional relevance, and clinical validation strongly supports PPARG as the causal gene for type 2 diabetes in this genomic region.\n\n---\n\n**References:**\n[1] PubMed literature search results showing 900+ papers linking PPARG to type 2 diabetes\n[2] PubMed literature search results showing 982 papers linking RAF1 to type 2 diabetes  \n[3] PubMed literature search results showing 56 papers linking SYN2 to type 2 diabetes\n[4] Clinical evidence for thiazolidinedione drugs targeting PPARG for diabetes treatment\n[5] Biological function analysis showing PPARG's direct metabolic control mechanisms\n[6] GWAS catalog evidence demonstrating PPARG gene variants associated with diabetes risk",
