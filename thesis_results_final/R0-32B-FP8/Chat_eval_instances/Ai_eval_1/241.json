Extensive literature evidence (664 papers)\n2. Direct clinical relevance to chronic rhinosinusitis treatment\n3. Biologically plausible mechanism through immune/inflammatory pathways\n4. Superior evidence compared to other candidate genes\n\n---\n\n**References:**\n[1] IL4R literature search results showing 664 papers related to chronic rhinosinusitis and nasal polyps  \n[2] IL21R literature search results showing 183 papers related to nasal polyposis and sinusitis",
