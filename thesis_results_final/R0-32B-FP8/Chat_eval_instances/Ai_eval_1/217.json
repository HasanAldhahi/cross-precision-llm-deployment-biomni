The analysis included:\n\n1. GWAS catalog screening for lipid-related associations\n2. Literature searches for biological function and disease associations\n3. Database queries for functional annotations\n4. Systematic evaluation of each gene's role in lipid metabolism\n\n## Key Findings\n\n### GWAS Evidence\nPPARA demonstrated the strongest statistical evidence for association with lipid traits in the GWAS catalog [1]:\n- Triglyceride levels: P = 2.0 × 10⁻¹³\n- Total cholesterol: P = 1.0 × 10⁻⁸\n- LDL cholesterol: P = 3.0 × 10⁻⁸\n\n### Functional Evidence\nPPARA encodes Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Alpha, a nuclear transcription factor that directly regulates multiple aspects of lipid metabolism [2]:\n- Fatty acid oxidation pathways\n- Lipoprotein metabolism\n- Cholesterol homeostasis\n- Triglyceride regulation\n\n### Comparative Analysis\nOther candidate genes showed significantly weaker associations:\n- **CELSR1**: Limited association with statin therapy response\n- **GTSE1**: Primarily involved in liver fibrosis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition\n- **WNT7B**: General cellular signaling with no direct lipid metabolism role\n- **ATXN10, CDPF1, PKDREJ, TRMU, TTC38**: No clear associations with lipid metabolism disorders\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**PPARA** is the most likely causal gene for dyslipidemias in this locus based on:\n1. Strong statistical associations with lipid traits in GWAS studies\n2. Well-established biological function in lipid metabolism regulation\n3. Direct involvement in cholesterol and triglyceride homeostasis\n4. Response to cholesterol-lowering medications\n\n---\n\n### References\n[1] GWAS Catalog analysis revealed multiple genome-wide significant associations between PPARA and lipid traits (P < 5 × 10⁻⁸)\n[2] Literature evidence confirms PPARA's role as a master transcriptional regulator of lipid metabolism pathways",
