Other genes primarily associated with developmental, neurological, or structural disorders unrelated to blood coagulation.\n\n## Conclusion\n**F2 is identified as the most likely causal gene** for hemorrhage phenotype based on:\n1. Multiple independent associations across different hemorrhage types\n2. Direct involvement in blood coagulation pathways\n3. Strong biological plausibility for hemorrhage susceptibility\n4. Consistent presence in GWAS and disease association databases\n\n---\n\n**References:**\n[1] DisGeNET database analysis revealed F2 associations with 7 hemorrhage-related disorders including Brain hemorrhage, Cerebral Hemorrhage, Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage, Gingival Hemorrhage, Hemorrhage, Intracranial Hemorrhages, and Subarachnoid Hemorrhage.",
