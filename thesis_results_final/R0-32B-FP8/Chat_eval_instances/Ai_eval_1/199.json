Uterine atony (loss of uterine muscle tone) is the leading cause of postpartum hemorrhage, making OXTR functionally relevant to the phenotype.\n\n### Other Genes - Limited Evidence\n\n**CAV3 (Caveolin-3)**: Limited to mammary tumor formation and urinary retention studies, no direct postpartum hemorrhage associations found.\n\n**LMCD1**: Found in prostate cancer, ovarian cancer, and kidney injury studies, but no reproductive system connections identified.\n\n**RAD18, SRGAP3, SSUH2**: No significant associations with postpartum hemorrhage found in literature or database searches.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**OXTR** is the most likely causal gene for postpartum hemorrhage based on:\n\n1. **Strong Literature Support**: Multiple independent studies demonstrate direct associations between OXTR variants and postpartum hemorrhage\n2. **Functional Relevance**: Oxytocin receptor controls uterine contractions, and uterine atony is the primary cause of postpartum hemorrhage\n3. **Mechanistic Evidence**: Studies show OXTR variants affect myometrial responsiveness and signaling profiles\n4. **Clinical Relevance**: OXTR dysfunction could explain increased clinical risk for postpartum hemorrhage\n\nThe other genes in the locus lack direct biological connections to postpartum hemorrhage, supporting OXTR as the primary candidate for this phenotype.\n\n---\n\n**References:**\n[1] Multiple independent studies showing OXTR variants associate with postpartum hemorrhage  \n[2] \"A Common OXTR Risk Variant Alters Regulation of Gene Expression by DNA Hydroxymethylation in Pregnant Human Myometrium\"  \n[3] \"Oxytocin receptor DNA methylation is associated with exogenous oxytocin needs during parturition and postpartum hemorrhage\"  \n[4] \"Oxytocin receptor single nucleotide polymorphism predicts atony-related postpartum hemorrhage\"",
