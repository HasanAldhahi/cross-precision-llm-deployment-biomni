Query of the GWAS Catalog for schizophrenia-associated genetic variants\n2. Systematic examination of the DisGeNET gene-disease association database \n3. Functional annotation of candidate genes using gene information databases\n4. Comparative analysis of each candidate gene's association with schizophrenia\n\n## Results\n\n### Gene-Disease Association Analysis\n\n**HTR7**: Found in the DisGeNET database as directly associated with schizophrenia [1]\n- Appears in the main \"Schizophrenia\" disorder gene list\n- Also associated with other psychiatric conditions including depression and anxiety\n- Located on chromosome 10 (ENSG00000148680)\n- Protein-coding gene with multiple transcript variants\n\n**Other Candidate Genes**: No associations with schizophrenia found in DisGeNET\n- ANKRD1: Associated with cardiovascular disorders and skeletal abnormalities\n- PCGF5: No disorders found in the database\n- RPP30: No disorders found in the database\n\n### Biological Function Analysis\n\n**HTR7** encodes the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 7, a serotonin receptor subtype 7 [2]\n- Serotonin signaling pathway is fundamentally implicated in schizophrenia pathophysiology\n- This represents direct mechanistic biological relevance to the disorder\n- Multiple antipsychotic medications target serotonin receptors\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**HTR7** is identified as the most likely causal gene for schizophrenia in this locus based on:\n\n1. **Direct evidence**: Only candidate gene with documented association in DisGeNET\n2. **Biological plausibility**: Serotonin receptor function directly relevant to schizophrenia\n3. **Database consistency**: Multiple psychiatric associations support functional role\n4. **Exclusion of alternatives**: Other candidates lack schizophrenia-specific associations\n\n## References\n\n[1] DisGeNET database analysis showing HTR7 association with schizophrenia disorders  \n[2] Gene functional annotation confirming HTR7 encodes 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 7 (serotonin receptor)",
