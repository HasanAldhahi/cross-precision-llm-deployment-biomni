Phenotypic Match Analysis\nKleefstra syndrome 2, associated with KMT2C mutations, is characterized by [1]:\n\n- **Intellectual disability and developmental delays** - matches HP:0010864 and HP:0001263\n- **Distinctive facial features** - matches multiple craniofacial HP codes\n- **Growth retardation** - matches HP:0004322 (microcephaly) and HP:0032071 (short stature)\n- **Cardiac anomalies** - matches HP:0001647, HP:0001680, and HP:0011675\n- **Neurological features** - matches HP:0002293 (hypotonia) and HP:0001250 (seizures)\n\n### 2. Database Validation\nOMIM database analysis confirmed KMT2C (ENSG00000055609) is associated with Kleefstra syndrome 2 (OMIM #617768), with autosomal dominant inheritance pattern.\n\n### 3. Differential Diagnosis Exclusion\nOther candidate genes were excluded based on phenotype mismatch:\n- **NLRP3**: Associated with inflammatory syndromes (periodic fever, cold-induced inflammation)\n- **ACAT1/SLC25A15**: Associated with metabolic disorders (aciduria, hyperornithinemia)\n- **ZFYVE26/CPT1C**: Associated with spastic paraplegia (primarily movement disorders)\n- **SPEN**: Associated with radiation sensitivity syndrome\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe patient's phenotype constellation strongly matches the clinical features of **Kleefstra syndrome 2**, which is caused by mutations in **KMT2C (ENSG00000055609)**. This gene encodes lysine-specific methyltransferase 2C, a chromatin modifier involved in transcriptional regulation during development.\n\n**Recommended Causal Gene**: KMT2C (ENSG00000055609)\n\n---\n\n### References\n[1] OMIM database analysis revealed KMT2C association with Kleefstra syndrome 2 (OMIM #617768), characterized by the multi-system phenotype observed in this patient.",
