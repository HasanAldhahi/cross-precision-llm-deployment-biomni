The ORF lengths were comparable across all options (average length: 211-222 nucleotides).\n\n### Translation Initiation Context\nThe critical difference between sequences lies in the Kozak sequence context around the first AUG start codon. The optimal human Kozak consensus sequence is **(gcc)gccRccAUGG** where R represents a purine (A or G) [1].\n\n### Kozak Sequence Evaluation\nAnalysis of the two most important Kozak positions revealed:\n\n| Option | Position -4 | Position -3 | Score |\n|--------|-------------|-------------|-------|\n| A | C (should be G) | G (purine) | 0/2 |\n| B | C (should be G) | C (should be purine) | 0/2 |\n| D | C (should be G) | U (should be purine) | 0/2 |\n| **E** | **C (should be G)** | **A (purine)** | **1/2** |\n\n## Conclusion\n\nOption **E** contains the ORF most likely to have high translation efficiency in human cells. This sequence has an optimal purine (adenine) at position -3 relative to the AUG start codon, which is the most critical factor for efficient translation initiation in eukaryotic systems [2].\n\nWhile Option E does not have the ideal guanine at position -4, the presence of a purine at position -3 provides the strongest context for ribosome binding and translation initiation among all the tested sequences.\n\n**Answer: E**\n\n---\n\n**References:**\n[1] Kozak sequence consensus based on eukaryotic translation initiation requirements\n[2] Position -3 relative to AUG is the highest priority determinant of translation efficiency in human cells",
