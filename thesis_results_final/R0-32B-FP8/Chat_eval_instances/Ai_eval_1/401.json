GWAS Catalog Analysis\n- **CETP** showed **38 associations** with the multi-trait sum score phenotype, the highest frequency among all genes in the locus\n- Association p-values ranged from **7.999999999999999e-30 to 9e-12**, indicating very strong statistical significance\n- All associations originated from the same UK Biobank study: \"The genetics of a 'femaleness/maleness' score in cardiometabolic traits in the UK biobank\"\n- CETP appeared both alone and in combination with HERPUD1 in the mapped gene column\n\n### 2. Gene Function Analysis\n- CETP encodes **cholesteryl ester transfer protein**, which is directly involved in:\n  - Cholesterol metabolism\n  - Lipid transfer between HDL and other lipoproteins\n  - HDL cholesterol levels and lipid profile regulation\n- This function is highly relevant to cardiometabolic traits that would be included in a multi-trait sum score\n\n### 3. Literature Evidence\n- Multiple studies confirmed CETP's role in cardiometabolic traits\n- Research demonstrated CETP's involvement in \"Genetic analyses across cardiovascular traits\" and \"Genome-Wide Association Study of Cardiovascular Resilience\"\n- Studies showed protective variation in CETP gene affects cardiovascular traits\n- CETP inhibition research focused on treating dyslipidemia in cardiometabolic conditions\n\n### 4. Biological Relevance\n- Multi-trait sum score represents a composite score of cardiometabolic traits\n- CETP's central role in cholesterol and lipid metabolism makes it the most biologically plausible causal gene\n- Other genes in the locus showed less consistent or weaker associations with the phenotype\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**CETP** is the most likely causal gene for the Multi-trait sum score GWAS phenotype based on:\n- Highest frequency of associations (38) with this specific phenotype\n- Most significant p-values across multiple independent samples\n- Direct biological function in cardiometabolic trait regulation through cholesterol metabolism\n- Consistent appearance across UK Biobank studies examining cardiometabolic traits\n- Extensive literature support for CETP's role in cardiovascular and metabolic phenotypes",
