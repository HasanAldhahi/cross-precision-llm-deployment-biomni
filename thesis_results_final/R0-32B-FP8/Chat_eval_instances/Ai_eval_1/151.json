This gene is associated with multiple X-linked conditions that collectively explain the patient's complex multisystem presentation.\n\n## Patient Phenotype Analysis\n\nThe patient presents with 12 distinct phenotypes spanning multiple organ systems:\n\n### Cardiac Manifestations\n- **HP:0001643**: Patent ductus arteriosus\n- **HP:0001717**: Coronary artery calcification\n\n### Gastrointestinal Manifestations\n- **HP:0002024**: Malabsorption\n- **HP:0000776**: Congenital diaphragmatic hernia\n\n### Neurological/Behavioral Manifestations\n- **HP:0000742**: Self-mutilation\n- **HP:0002354**: Memory impairment  \n- **HP:0000752**: Hyperactivity\n- **HP:0002487**: Hyperkinetic movements\n\n### Additional Manifestations\n- **HP:0006288**: Advanced eruption of teeth\n- **HP:0002719**: Recurrent infections\n- **HP:0000989**: Pruritus\n- **HP:0012578**: Membranous nephropathy\n\n## Candidate Gene Analysis\n\nFrom the 14 candidate genes analyzed, several showed potential disease associations:\n\n### Primary Candidates with Multisystem Involvement\n- **FLNA**: Associated with multiple X-linked conditions affecting cardiac, gastrointestinal, and neurological systems\n- **HPRT1**: Associated with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (neurological, self-mutilation)\n- **POLG**: Associated with mitochondrial disorders\n\n### Secondary Candidates with Limited System Involvement\n- **PPOX**: Associated with variegate porphyria (metabolic)\n- **PRRX1**: Associated with developmental facial anomalies\n- **HADH**: Associated with metabolic disorders\n- **PSTPIP1**: Associated with autoinflammatory syndromes\n- **LAMA3**: Associated with epidermolysis bullosa (skin)\n\n## Key Findings\n\n### FLNA Disease Associations (From OMIM)\n1. **Otopalatodigital syndrome, type II** - X-linked dominant condition affecting multiple systems\n2. **Intestinal pseudoobstruction, neuronal** - X-linked recessive condition explaining GI symptoms\n3. **Cardiac valvular dysplasia, X-linked** - Explains cardiac manifestations\n4. **Melnick-Needles syndrome** - X-linked dominant condition with multisystem involvement\n5. **Congenital short bowel syndrome** - X-linked recessive condition affecting GI function\n\n### Clinical Correlation\nThe patient's phenotype constellation of cardiac defects (patent ductus arteriosus, coronary artery calcification), gastrointestinal issues (malabsorption, congenital diaphragmatic hernia), and neurological/behavioral symptoms (memory impairment, hyperactivity, self-mutilation, hyperkinetic movements) is most consistent with **FLNA-related X-linked disorders**.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**Causal Gene: FLNA (ENSG00000196924)**\n\nThe patient's complex multisystem phenotype involving cardiac, gastrointestinal, and neurological manifestations strongly points to FLNA as the causal gene. This gene is associated with several X-linked conditions that collectively explain the observed phenotype constellation, making it the most likely candidate among the 14 genes analyzed.\n\n---\n\n*Analysis conducted using comprehensive phenotype-gene association databases including OMIM, Monarch Initiative, and GWAS Catalog.*",
