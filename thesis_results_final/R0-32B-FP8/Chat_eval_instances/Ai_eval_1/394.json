GWAS Association Strength\nFrom systematic analysis of the GWAS catalog data, three genes showed associations with \"Multi-trait sex score\":\n\n- **LPL**: 17 independent associations with p-values ranging from 1e-60 to 5e-16\n- **INTS10**: 6 associations with p-values ranging from 9e-83 to 9e-26\n- **CSGALNACT1**: 4 associations with p-values ranging from 8e-14 to 5e-10\n\n### 2. Biological Plausibility\n\n**Multi-trait sex score** is based on a \"femaleness/maleness\" score in cardiometabolic traits from UK Biobank, specifically related to:\n- Lipid metabolism profiles\n- HDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels  \n- Metabolic syndrome components\n- Sex hormone-related metabolic pathways\n\n**LPL (Lipoprotein Lipase)** demonstrates the highest biological relevance:\n- Key enzyme in lipid metabolism, directly breaking down triglycerides\n- Well-established sex differences in LPL expression and activity\n- Directly regulated by sex hormones (testosterone and estrogen)\n- Central to cardiometabolic traits showing sex differences\n- Extensive literature documenting sex-specific effects on lipid profiles\n\n### 3. Literature Evidence\n\nMultiple studies confirm sex-specific regulation of LPL:\n- Sex hormones differently regulate lipid metabolism genes including LPL [1]\n- Direct effects of sex steroid hormones on adipose tissues and obesity [2]\n- Sex steroids affect plasma lipoprotein levels in estrogen-deficient states [3]\n\n### 4. Other Candidate Genes\n\n**Less biologically relevant genes:**\n- **ATP6V1B2**: V-type proton ATPase subunit (cellular pH regulation)\n- **CSGALNACT1**: Chondroitin sulfate N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis)\n- **INTS10**: Integrator complex subunit (transcription regulation)\n- **LZTS1**: Leucine zipper tumor suppressor (cancer-related)\n- **SLC18A1**: Vesicular monoamine transporter (neurotransmitter transport)\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**LPL** is identified as the most likely causal gene for Multi-trait sex score based on:\n1. Strongest statistical associations (most significant p-values)\n2. Direct biological relevance to cardiometabolic sex differences\n3. Established hormone-driven regulation of lipid metabolism\n4. Extensive GWAS evidence across multiple cardiometabolic traits\n\n---\n\n### References\n[1] Sex hormones differently regulate lipid metabolism genes in primary human hepatocytes  \n[2] Direct effects of sex steroid hormones on adipose tissues and obesity  \n[3] Sex steroids and plasma lipoprotein levels in healthy women: The importance of androgens in the estrogen-deficient state",
