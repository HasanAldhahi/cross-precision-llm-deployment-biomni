Extensive functional role in cholesterol homeostasis\n2. Direct regulation of LDLR, the primary receptor for cholesterol metabolism\n3. Highest number of GWAS associations with lipid traits (690)\n4. Well-documented pathogenic variants in ClinVar for cholesterol disorders\n5. Strong phenotypic associations in OMIM for familial hypercholesterolemia\n\nThe convergence of evidence across multiple independent databases and the well-established biological mechanism make PCSK9 the most compelling candidate for causality in lipoid metabolism disorders.\n\n---\n\n**References:**\n[1] UniProt functional annotation showing PCSK9's role in cholesterol homeostasis and LDLR regulation  \n[2] GWAS Catalog showing 690 lipid metabolism trait associations  \n[3] ClinVar database showing pathogenic variants in PCSK9  \n[4] OMIM database showing familial hypercholesterolemia associations  \n[5] PubMed literature documenting PCSK9 in familial hypercholesterolemia research  \n[6] UniProt functional annotation showing DHCR24's role in cholesterol biosynthesis",
