The analysis included:\n\n1. PubMed literature searches for NAFLD associations\n2. GWAS catalog database queries\n3. Functional pathway analysis\n4. Comparative evidence evaluation\n\n## Results\n\n### Literature Evidence Analysis\n\n**NR1H4 (Farnesoid X-activated receptor)** demonstrated the strongest evidence with multiple recent publications directly linking it to NAFLD/MASH (metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis) [1-8]. Key findings include:\n\n- **Multiple therapeutic studies**: FXR agonists ameliorate NAFLD through bile acid-FXR axis modulation\n- **Direct pathogenic involvement**: NR1H4 deletion leads to more severe MASH development\n- **Metabolic regulation**: Controls bile acid homeostasis, lipid metabolism, and glucose homeostasis\n\n**Other candidate genes** showed minimal literature evidence:\n- ACTR6, ANO4, BLTP3B, DEPDC4, GAS2L3, SCYL2, and SLC17A8 had no clear direct associations with NAFLD pathogenesis\n\n### Functional Analysis\n\nNR1H4 encodes the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), a nuclear receptor that functions as:\n- **Bile acid receptor**: Regulates bile acid synthesis, conjugation, and enterohepatic circulation\n- **Lipid metabolism regulator**: Controls hepatic de novo lipogenesis and lipid homeostasis\n- **Glucose homeostasis modulator**: Regulates hepatic gluconeogenesis and insulin sensitivity\n- **Anti-inflammatory mediator**: Suppresses liver inflammation through NF-κB signaling modulation\n\n### GWAS Evidence\n\nWhile direct GWAS associations were limited for most candidate genes, the literature consistently identified FXR (NR1H4) as a key therapeutic target for NAFLD treatment across multiple genetic models.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe identification of NR1H4 as the likely causal gene is supported by several lines of evidence:\n\n1. **Direct mechanistic involvement**: NR1H4/FXR is a well-established regulator of hepatic metabolism and bile acid signaling, both central to NAFLD pathogenesis [2,4,6]\n\n2. **Therapeutic validation**: Multiple studies demonstrate that FXR agonists effectively treat NAFLD/MASH, confirming the gene's causal role [1,3,5]\n\n3. **Knockdown studies**: Ileal FXR knockdown ameliorates MASLD progression, while hepatic FXR deletion exacerbates disease development [7,8]\n\n4. **Comprehensive pathway involvement**: NR1H4 regulates multiple interconnected pathways relevant to NAFLD including bile acid metabolism, lipid homeostasis, and inflammatory responses\n\nThe other candidate genes showed no compelling evidence for direct involvement in NAFLD pathogenesis based on current literature.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**NR1H4** is the most likely causal gene for Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease within this locus, supported by strong mechanistic evidence, therapeutic validation, and direct involvement in disease pathogenesis through bile acid and metabolic signaling pathways.\n\n---\n\n### References\n[1] ACT001 alleviates MASLD through gut microbiota-bile acid-FXR axis in mice  \n[2] Stachyose attenuates hepatic cholesterol deposition in nonalcoholic fatty liver mice  \n[3] n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids mediate hyodeoxycholic acid-FXR signaling  \n[4] Celastrol ameliorates metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis  \n[5] 5-Heptadecylresorcinol ameliorates high-fat diet-induced NAFLD  \n[6] Bile acid-mediated gut-liver axis crosstalk via nuclear receptor signaling  \n[7] Ileal FXR knockdown ameliorates MASLD progression in rats  \n[8] Deletion of hepatic FXR leads to more severe MASH development",
