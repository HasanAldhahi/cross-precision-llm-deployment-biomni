This variant demonstrates the strongest statistical associations and most comprehensive profile among all candidate variants.\n\n## Methodology\n\nA systematic analysis was conducted using the GWAS catalog database to evaluate 11 candidate variants for their associations with HDL cholesterol measurement. The analysis focused on:\n\n- Statistical significance (p-values)\n- Effect sizes (OR/Beta values)\n- Specificity to HDL cholesterol traits\n- Consistency across independent studies\n\n## Key Findings\n\n### Primary Candidate: rs6073958\n\n**rs6073958** emerged as the top variant based on the following evidence:\n\n- **Multiple HDL associations**: 5 independent associations with HDL cholesterol measurement traits\n- **Statistical significance**: P-values ranging from 0.0 (essentially < machine precision) to 7e-295\n- **Trait specificity**: Direct associations with HDL cholesterol particle composition and concentration\n- **Effect sizes**: Moderate to strong effect sizes (0.16-0.20)\n\n**Top associations include:**\n- Total lipids in small HDL particles (P-value: 0.0)\n- Concentration of small HDL particles (P-value: 0.0)\n- Phospholipids in small HDL (P-value: 1e-320)\n- Phospholipids to total lipids ratio in large HDL (P-value: 4e-317)\n- Cholesteryl ester levels in large HDL (P-value: 2e-274)\n\n### Secondary Candidates\n\n**rs1532085**: Ranked second with very strong associations but less comprehensive profile\n- HDL cholesterol levels (P-value: 1e-213)\n- Cholesteryl esters to total lipids ratio in very large HDL (P-value: 2e-244)\n\n**rs2229738**: Moderate associations with HDL cholesterol traits\n- Free cholesterol to total lipids ratio in small LDL (P-value: 1e-14)\n- Cholesterol to total lipids ratio in large LDL (P-value: 3e-14)\n\n**rs2287623**: Primary associations with total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol\n- Cholesterol, total (P-value: 4e-12)\n- LDL cholesterol levels (P-value: 6e-08)\n\n### Variants with No HDL Associations\n\n- **rs9296404** (RAP1B): No HDL cholesterol associations found\n- **rs17711722** (SYPL2): No HDL cholesterol associations found\n- **rs748196** (CACNB2): No HDL cholesterol associations found\n- **rs1776029** (KMT2E): No HDL cholesterol associations found\n- **rs3738934** (FGF19): No HDL cholesterol associations found\n- **rs2100944** (ITGB1): No HDL cholesterol associations found\n- **rs1074145** (ZNF260): No HDL cholesterol associations found\n\n## Recommendation\n\n**rs6073958** is recommended as the most promising variant for further examination based on:\n\n1. **Strongest statistical evidence**: Extremly significant p-values across multiple independent studies\n2. **Phenotype specificity**: Direct associations with HDL cholesterol measurement traits rather than broader lipid profiles\n3. **Biological relevance**: Multiple associations with HDL particle composition and concentration suggest robust biological effects\n4. **Consistency**: Reproducible associations across different research groups and populations\n\n## Supporting Evidence\n\n[1] Multiple associations identified in the GWAS catalog with p-values ranging from 0.0 to 7e-295\n\n[2] Consistent associations across different HDL cholesterol measurement phenotypes including particle concentration, composition, and size distribution\n\n[3] Effect sizes (0.06-0.20) indicate meaningful biological impact on HDL cholesterol levels",
