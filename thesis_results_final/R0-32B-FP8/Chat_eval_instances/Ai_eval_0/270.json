  "last_200_tokens": "Given that TMED5 is involved in protein trafficking and transport, and considering the nature of vaccine responses: - Influenza vaccine response typically involves the most extensive protein trafficking for viral antigen presentation and rapid immune activation - Yellow fever vaccine response involves strong immune activation but is more focused on viral clearance - TB vaccine response is primarily cellular immunity Since TMED5's function is directly related to protein trafficking, which is essential for efficient immune cell communication and antigen presentation, it makes biological sense that it would be most relevant to influenza vaccine response, which requires the most extensive and rapid protein trafficking among the three options. Let me provide the final answer in the requested JSON format.</think> I'll provide the final answer based on my systematic analysis of the genes and their biological functions. **Plan:** 1. [✓] Search for TMED5 in MSigDB C7 immunologic signature gene sets (found 61 gene sets) 2. [✓] Search for literature on TMED5 function (found it's involved in protein trafficking and cancer) 3. [✓] Search for the other genes' functions (MROH1, SLC39A13, FARSB, PPFIA4) 4. [✓] Make final determination based on biological function <solution> {\"vaccine_response_geneset\": \"Gene expression profiles associated with influenza vaccine response\"} </solution>",
