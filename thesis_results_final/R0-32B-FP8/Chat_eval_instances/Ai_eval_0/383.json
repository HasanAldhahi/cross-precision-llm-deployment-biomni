This score likely incorporates parameters such as HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and other lipid metabolism markers that typically show sex differences, as these are classic examples of sexually dimorphic traits.\n\n## Methodology\n\nSystematic literature searches were conducted using PubMed and Google Scholar databases to investigate the biological functions and sex-specific associations of candidate genes: APOA1, APOA4, APOA5, APOC3, BUD13, PAFAH1B2, SIDT2, SIK3, TAGLN, and ZPR1.\n\n## Key Findings\n\n### APOA1 (Apolipoprotein A1)\n- **Primary function**: Encodes apolipoprotein A-I, the major component of HDL cholesterol\n- **Sex differences evidence**: Multiple studies demonstrate sex differences in HDL cholesterol levels associated with APOA1 variants\n- **Relevant literature**: \n  - \"Sex Differences in the Methylome and Transcriptome of the Human Liver and Circulating HDL-Cholesterol Levels\" (PMID: 29846646)\n  - Multiple papers showing sex-specific associations with HDL cholesterol metabolism\n- **Biological relevance**: HDL cholesterol shows strong sexual dimorphism, with women typically having higher levels than men\n\n### BUD13\n- **Primary function**: Involved in lipid metabolism as part of the APO gene cluster\n- **Sex differences evidence**: Found in gene clusters showing sex-specific dyslipidemia patterns\n- **Relevant literature**: \"Functional polymorphisms of the APOA1/C3/A4/A5-ZPR1-BUD13 gene cluster are associated with dyslipidemia in a sex-specific pattern\" (PMID: 30631647)\n\n### ZPR1 (Zinc Finger Protein 1)\n- **Primary function**: Transcription factor involved in regulating lipid metabolism genes\n- **Sex differences evidence**: Sex-specific associations with lipid levels identified\n- **Relevant literature**: \"Sex-specific association of the zinc finger protein 259 rs2075290 polymorphism and serum lipid levels\" (PMID: 24688311)\n\n### SIK3 (Salt-Inducible Kinase 3)\n- **Primary function**: Involved in metabolic regulation\n- **Sex differences evidence**: Female-specific genetic variants for metabolic syndrome identified\n- **Relevant literature**: \"Identification of female-specific genetic variants for metabolic syndrome and its component traits\" (PMID: 31170924)\n\n### Other genes (PAFAH1B2, SIDT2, TAGLN)\n- Limited evidence for sex-specific associations in the literature\n\n## Analysis and Conclusion\n\nThe evidence strongly supports **APOA1** as the causal gene for Multi-trait sex score based on several key factors:\n\n1. **Direct mechanistic link**: APOA1 encodes apolipoprotein A-I, the primary protein component of HDL cholesterol, which is a classic sexually dimorphic trait\n\n2. **Strong literature support**: Multiple independent studies demonstrate sex differences in APOA1 associations with HDL cholesterol levels\n\n3. **Biological plausibility**: HDL cholesterol levels show consistent sexual dimorphism across populations, making APOA1 variants highly relevant to multi-trait sex scores\n\n4. **GWAS relevance**: The APOA1 gene cluster (including APOA1, APOA4, APOA5, APOC3) is frequently associated with lipid metabolism traits that show sex differences\n\nWhile BUD13 and ZPR1 showed some evidence for sex-specific patterns, these appeared to be more indirect regulatory effects rather than direct trait associations. SIK3 showed female-specific associations with metabolic syndrome, but APOA1 has a more direct and fundamental role in sexually dimorphic metabolic traits.\n\n**Final Answer: APOA1**",
