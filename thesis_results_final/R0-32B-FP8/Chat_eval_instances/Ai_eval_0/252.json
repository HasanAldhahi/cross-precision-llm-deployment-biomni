The evidence consistently demonstrates AAV's superior effectiveness, safety, and established protocols for ocular gene editing.\n\n## Key Findings\n\n### 1. Literature Evidence for AAV Dominance\n\nMultiple recent studies confirm AAV as the preferred delivery method for mouse eye applications [1][2][3]. Research specifically demonstrates successful AAV-mediated gene therapy in mouse ocular models, including:\n\n- **Retinal pigment epithelium targeting** for treating oculocutaneous albinism type I [4]\n- **Retinal ganglion cell transduction** using intravitreal AAV injection protocols [5]\n- **AAV9.PHP.B** serotype specifically engineered for retinal targeting in disease models [6]\n\n### 2. Comparative Analysis of Delivery Methods\n\nWhile alternative methods like RNP/mRNA electroporation are mentioned in some studies, AAV consistently appears as the primary approach for in vivo mouse eye editing due to several advantages:\n\n#### AAV (Option f) - **Most Relevant**\n- High transduction efficiency for retinal cell types\n- Well-established safety profile for eye applications\n- Ability to deliver complete CRISPR-Cas9 systems effectively\n- Multiple engineered serotypes optimized for ocular delivery\n\n#### Other Methods - Less Relevant for Eye Applications\n- **Plasmid transfection**: Primarily used for in vitro applications\n- **Lentivirus/Retrovirus**: Not commonly used for eye applications due to integration concerns\n- **RNP/mRNA electroporation**: Mentioned but less frequently used for in vivo eye applications\n- **RNP/mRNA microinjection**: Typically used for embryos or accessible tissues, not eyes\n- **mRNA LNP**: Emerging but less established for eye applications\n\n### 3. Technical Advantages\n\nAAV offers several technical advantages for mouse eye editing:\n\n- **Tissue specificity**: Multiple AAV serotypes engineered for specific retinal cell targeting\n- **Delivery efficiency**: Demonstrated successful transduction of retinal ganglion cells and pigment epithelium\n- **Safety**: Well-characterized safety profile in ocular applications\n- **Protocol availability**: Established delivery protocols via intravitreal injection\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe evidence overwhelmingly supports **AAV (Option f)** as the most relevant delivery method for in vivo mouse eye editing applications. Its established protocols, superior transduction efficiency, and consistent use in recent research make it the optimal choice for this specific application.\n\n---\n\n### References\n[1] Multiple papers demonstrate AAV's consistent mention as preferred eye delivery method  \n[2] AAV9.PHP.B-based delivery successfully used for retinal gene editing in mice  \n[3] Tropism studies show AAV serotypes specifically engineered for retinal targeting  \n[4] RPE-targeting gene therapy successfully delivered via AAV to mouse models  \n[5] Protocols established for AAV-mediated transduction of mouse retinal ganglion cells  \n[6] Multiple studies demonstrate successful AAV delivery to mouse retinal cells",
