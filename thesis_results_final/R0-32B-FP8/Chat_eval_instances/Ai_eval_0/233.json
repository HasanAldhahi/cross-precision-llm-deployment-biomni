PubMed literature search for each candidate gene in relation to ovarian neoplasms\n2. GWAS Catalog queries for ovarian cancer associations  \n3. Database searches (OMIM, DisGeNET) for gene-disease relationships\n4. Functional pathway analysis for cancer relevance\n\n## Key Findings\n\n### SMARCE1 (BAF57) - **PRIMARY CANDIDATE**\n- **Function**: Chromatin remodeling protein, component of SWI/SNF complex\n- **Evidence**: Multiple studies demonstrate direct involvement in ovarian cancer invasion and metastasis\n- **Mechanism**: miR-615-3p/SMARCE1 pathway specifically promotes ovarian cancer metastatic potential\n- **Literature**: \"Long noncoding RNA HOTTIP promotes the metastatic potential of ovarian cancer through the regulation of the miR-615-3p/SMARCE1 pathway\"\n- **Significance**: Chromatin remodeling proteins directly impact transcriptional regulation of cancer-related genes\n\n### TOP2A (DNA Topoisomerase II Alpha) - **STRONG CANDIDATE**\n- **Function**: Essential for DNA replication and transcription\n- **Evidence**: Specific mutations identified in high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma\n- **Mechanism**: TOP2A knockdown reverses cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer\n- **Literature**: \"DNA Topoisomerase II Mutations in Cancer: Structural Impact and Drug Response in High-grade Serous Ovarian Carcinoma\"\n- **Significance**: Well-established oncogene with direct role in chemotherapy resistance\n\n### Additional Candidates\n- **CDC6**: DNA replication licensing factor involved in cancer progression from polycystic ovary syndrome to endometrial cancer\n- **RARA**: Nuclear receptor involved in ovarian cancer transcriptional regulation\n- **CASC3**: Long non-coding RNA associated with gynecologic cancers\n- **GSDMA/GSDMB**: Gasdermin genes involved in pyroptosis pathways in ovarian cancer\n\n## Decision Rationale\n\n**SMARCE1** was selected as the most likely causal gene based on:\n\n1. **Direct mechanistic involvement**: Specific regulatory pathways (miR-615-3p/SMARCE1) have been identified in ovarian cancer progression\n2. **Functional relevance**: Chromatin remodeling proteins directly impact gene expression patterns critical for cancer development\n3. **Consistent evidence**: Multiple independent studies demonstrate SMARCE1's role in ovarian cancer invasion and metastasis\n4. **Pathway specificity**: The miR-615-3p/SMARCE1 pathway represents a clear mechanistic link to ovarian cancer progression\n\nWhile **TOP2A** also showed compelling evidence through DNA replication mutations and chemotherapy resistance mechanisms, SMARCE1 demonstrates more direct involvement in the fundamental processes driving ovarian neoplasm development and progression.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**SMARCE1** represents the most likely causal gene for ovarian neoplasms based on comprehensive literature evidence showing direct involvement in ovarian cancer invasion, metastasis, and transcriptional regulation through specific mechanistic pathways.",
