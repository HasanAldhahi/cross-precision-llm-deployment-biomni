  "prompt": "Your task is to identify the gene with the strongest perturbation effect for the following research context:\n\nI hope to study the cellular mechanisms and pathways that contribute to the increased or decreased resistance of Huh-7.5 cells to HCoV-229E virus exposure over a period of 5 days at a dosage of 0.05 MOI. By understanding these mechanisms, we can identify potential therapeutic targets or strategies to enhance resistance to the virus in similar cell types.\n\nFrom the following list of candidate genes, select the ONE gene that would have the strongest perturbation effect in this experimental context:\n\nCandidate genes: FGL1, NR1D2, ANPEP, APOB, VMAC, CCDC57, DSTYK, C3orf70, CBX8, SPATA5, TRIM50\n\nOutput only the gene symbol of your choice, e.g., BRCA1",
