GWAS Catalog database queries for breast cancer associations\n2. DisGeNET gene-disease association database analysis  \n3. OMIM genetic disorders database review\n4. PubMed literature searches for functional relevance\n5. EFO (Experimental Factor Ontology) trait database queries\n\n## Key Findings\n\n### ESR1 - Primary Candidate Gene\n\n**ESR1** demonstrated the strongest evidence for breast cancer causality across all databases:\n\n#### DisGeNET Database (31+ associations)\n- Breast Cancer, Familial Male\n- Breast Cancer, Familial  \n- Breast cancer, lobular\n- BREAST CANCER, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO\n- Advanced breast cancer\n- BREAST CANCER 3\n- Early-Stage Breast Carcinoma\n- Invasive Ductal Breast Carcinoma\n- Invasive Lobular Breast Carcinoma\n- Lobular carcinoma in situ of breast\n- Luminal A Breast Carcinoma\n- Luminal B Breast Carcinoma\n- Malignant neoplasm of breast\n- Malignant neoplasm of female breast\n- Premenopausal breast cancer\n- Stage IV Breast Cancer AJCC v6 and v7\n- Triple Negative Breast Neoplasms\n\n#### OMIM Database\n- Associated with breast cancer (MIM number: 114480)\n\n#### Literature Evidence\n- ESR1 encodes estrogen receptor alpha (ERα), a key driver gene in breast cancer biology\n- Multiple papers demonstrate ESR1 mutations and fusion genes associated with breast cancer\n- ESR1 involved in breast cancer drug resistance mechanisms\n- Literature confirms ESR1's role in \"ER+ breast cancer cells\" and \"estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer\"\n\n### Other Candidate Genes\n\n**AKAP12**: Limited evidence - primarily associated with TNBC and drug resistance, not cancer causality\n\n**CCDC170, RMND1, SYNE1, ZBTB2**: Minimal associations with breast cancer in GWAS studies, with much weaker evidence\n\n## Biological Significance\n\nESR1 encodes the estrogen receptor alpha protein, which is:\n- One of the most important genes in breast cancer biology\n- A key driver of breast cancer development and progression\n- Present in ~70% of breast cancer cases (ER+ breast cancer)\n- Critical for breast cancer treatment decisions (hormonal therapy)\n- Well-established breast cancer susceptibility gene\n\n## EFO Trait Information\n\nEFO trait for breast cancer:\n- **Trait ID**: MONDO_0007254\n- **URI**: http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0007254\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**ESR1** is the clear causal gene for breast cancer in this locus based on:\n- Extensive database evidence across multiple sources\n- Direct functional relevance to breast cancer biology\n- Well-established role as a breast cancer susceptibility gene\n- Strong literature support for ESR1's involvement in breast cancer\n\nThe other candidate genes showed significantly weaker associations with breast cancer, primarily related to drug resistance or having much less prominent roles in cancer biology.",
