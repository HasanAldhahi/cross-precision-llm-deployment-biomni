Searched GWAS catalog for atrial fibrillation associations\n2. Analyzed each gene's functional role in cardiac electrophysiology\n3. Conducted literature review using PubMed to evaluate evidence strength\n4. Assessed mechanistic pathways linking genes to atrial fibrillation\n\n## Key Findings\n\n### KCNH2 (hERG Potassium Channel) - **PRIMARY CANDIDATE**\n- **Function**: Encodes the human ether-a-go-go related gene (hERG) potassium channel, essential for cardiac repolarization\n- **Evidence Strength**: Very strong\n- **Literature Support**: 5+ papers directly linking KCNH2 to atrial fibrillation including:\n  - Clinical studies of early-onset atrial fibrillation in long QT syndrome patients [1]\n  - Research on atrial vulnerability to atrial fibrillation from KCNH2 mutations [2]\n  - Analysis of KCNH2 genetic polymorphisms with cardiac arrhythmias [3]\n  - Studies showing KCNH2's role in atrial fibrillation-induced cardiomyopathy [4]\n\n### NOS3 (Endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase) - **SECONDARY CANDIDATE**\n- **Function**: Encodes endothelial nitric oxide synthase, involved in cardiac remodeling\n- **Evidence Strength**: Moderate\n- **Literature Support**: Papers analyzing NOS3 as a candidate locus for non-valvular atrial fibrillation predisposition [5]\n- **Mechanism**: More indirect role through atrial remodeling rather than direct electrophysiology\n\n### Other Genes - **LIMITED EVIDENCE**\n- **TMEM176A/B**: Papers related to immune cell infiltration in atrial fibrillation (secondary effects)\n- **CDK5, SMARCD3, ENSG00000248282**: Minimal to no relevant literature evidence for atrial fibrillation associations\n- **SMARCD3**: SWI/SNF complex component involved in chromatin remodeling\n- **TMEM176A/B**: Transmembrane proteins involved in innate immunity\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**KCNH2 is the most likely causal gene for atrial fibrillation** within this locus based on:\n\n1. **Direct mechanistic relevance**: KCNH2 encodes the hERG potassium channel, which is fundamental to cardiac electrophysiology and repolarization\n2. **Strong literature evidence**: Multiple recent papers specifically linking KCNH2 mutations and polymorphisms to atrial fibrillation\n3. **Clinical significance**: KCNH2 mutations cause long QT syndrome, which can directly lead to atrial fibrillation\n4. **Functional pathway**: Direct involvement in cardiac arrhythmogenesis through disruption of normal repolarization patterns\n\n---\n\n*References:*\n[1] Clinical presentation and genetic characterization of early-onset atrial fibrillation in patients affected by long QT syndrome  \n[2] Influence of genetic mutations to atria vulnerability to atrial fibrillation  \n[3] Dissecting the associations of KCNH2 genetic polymorphisms with various types of cardiac arrhythmias  \n[4] Copy Number Variants in Cardiac Channelopathies affecting atrial fibrillation risk  \n[5] Analysis of minK and eNOS genes as candidate loci for predisposition to non-valvular atrial fibrillation",
