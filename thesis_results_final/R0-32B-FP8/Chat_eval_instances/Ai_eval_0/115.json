The evidence strongly supports a direct mechanistic role for OXTR in postpartum hemorrhage and associated uterine dysfunction phenotypes, with multiple lines of literature supporting this conclusion.\n\n---\n\n### References\n[1] Oxytocin receptor essential for uterine contractions during labor  \n[2] OXTR SNP association with atony-related postpartum hemorrhage  \n[3] OXTR as primary target of oxytocin therapy for postpartum hemorrhage  \n[4] OXTR dysfunction in myometrial contraction disorders  \n[5] OXTR risk variants affecting myometrial gene regulation during pregnancy",
