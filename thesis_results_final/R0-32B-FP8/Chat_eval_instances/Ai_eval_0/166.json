Through systematic sequence analysis, **Option C** was identified as the correctly designed primer pair that meets all requirements for successful directional cloning.\n\n## Background\n\nThe task involves designing primers for molecular cloning where:\n- **Vector preparation**: HindII restriction enzyme linearizes the vector by cutting at its recognition sequence GTYRAC\n- **Gene of interest**: *rsxD* gene with specific start (5') and end (3') sequences\n- **Cloning requirement**: Primers must contain homology to both vector ends plus the gene sequences for amplification\n\n## Methodology\n\n1. **Vector end identification**: HindII recognition sequence (GTYRAC) determines cut sites\n2. **Gene sequence mapping**: Located *rsxD* start (ATGGTATTCAGAATAGCTAGCTCCC) and end (TTACCCTTTGCGATG) sequences\n3. **Primer structure analysis**: Examined each option for:\n   - Vector 5' end homology (sequences before HindII cut)\n   - Vector 3' end homology (sequences after HindII cut)\n   - *rsxD* gene start and end sequences\n\n## Results\n\n### HindII Recognition and Cut Sites\n- **Recognition sequence**: GTYRAC\n- **Cut pattern**: Creates two vector ends: ...GTYRAC and GTYRAC...\n\n### *rsxD* Gene Sequences\n- **Start sequence**: ATGGTATTCAGAATAGCTAGCTCCC\n- **End sequence**: TTACCCTTTGCGATG\n\n### Primer Analysis Summary\n\n| Option | Forward Primer | Reverse Primer | Overall |\n|--------|----------------|----------------|---------|\n| B | Has vector 5' homology ✗ Missing gene start | Has vector 3' homology ✗ Missing gene end | ❌ |\n| C | Has vector 5' homology ✓ Contains gene start | Has vector 3' homology ✓ Contains gene end | ✅ |\n| D | ✗ Missing proper vector homology | ✗ Missing proper vector homology | ❌ |\n| E | Has vector 5' homology ✗ Missing gene start | Has vector 3' homology ✗ Missing gene end | ❌ |\n\n### Option C Detailed Analysis\n\n**Forward Primer**: GATTACGCCAAGCTTGCATGCCTGCAGGTCATGGTATTCAGAATAGCTAGCTCCCC\n- Vector 5' homology: GATTACGCCAAGCTTGC ✓\n- *rsxD* gene start: ATGGTATTCAGAATAGCTAGCTCCC ✓\n- Structure: Vector_homology + Gene_start\n\n**Reverse Primer**: GAGCTCGGTACCCGGGGATCCTCTAGAGTCTTACCCTTTGCGATGGCCGTAG\n- Vector 3' homology: GAGCTCGGTACCCGGGGATCCTCTAGAGTCT ✓\n- *rsxD* gene end: TTACCCTTTGCGATG ✓  \n- Structure: Vector_homology + Gene_end\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**Recommended Option: C**\n\nOption C primers are the only ones that correctly contain:\n1. Homology to both HindII-linearized vector ends\n2. Complete *rsxD* gene start and end sequences\n3. Proper primer structure for directional cloning\n\nThe forward primer contains vector 5' end homology followed by the *rsxD* gene start sequence, while the reverse primer contains vector 3' end homology followed by the *rsxD* gene end sequence, making them suitable for PCR amplification and subsequent cloning into the HindII-linearized vector.\n\n## References\n\n- HindII restriction enzyme recognition sequence analysis\n- Vector linearization principles\n- Primer design protocols for directional cloning\n- Sequence alignment verification methods",
