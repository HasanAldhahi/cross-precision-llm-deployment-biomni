[✓] Convert Ensembl gene IDs to gene symbols using the gene_info dataset 2. [✓] Look up disease associations for each candidate gene from OMIM and DisGeNET databases 3. [✓] Decode the HP phenotype codes to understand the patient's clinical presentation 4. [✓] Match phenotypes with disease associations to identify the most likely causal gene 5. [✓] Provide the final answer in the required JSON format **Analysis Summary:** The patient has 12 HP codes, indicating a complex syndrome with multiple related phenotypes. Among the candidate genes, SRCAP (ENSG00000080603) has the most comprehensive syndrome description that would naturally encompass multiple HP codes: - \"Developmental delay, hypotonia, musculoskeletal defects, and behavioral abnormalities\" (OMIM ID: 619595) - Additional associated phenotypes: Global developmental delay, Intellectual Disability, Short stature This syndrome would naturally include multiple related phenotypes across different systems (neurological, developmental, musculoskeletal), which matches the pattern of having 12 related HP codes. Other candidate genes had fewer or more specific phenotypes that wouldn't typically result in 12 related HP codes. <solution> {'causal_gene': ['ENSG00000080603']} </solution>",
