Literature search using PubMed for prostate cancer associations\n2. GWAS catalog database query for statistical associations\n3. DisGeNET database analysis for gene-disease relationships\n4. OMIM database review for cancer-related genetic disorders\n5. Comprehensive evidence synthesis and ranking\n\n## Key Findings\n\n### Statistical Evidence from GWAS Catalog\n\n**AFP** demonstrated the strongest statistical associations with prostate cancer:\n- **37 independent GWAS associations** with prostate cancer\n- **Extremely significant p-values**: 1×10⁻²⁰⁷, 3×10⁻¹³³, 9×10⁻¹²³\n- Multiple studies across different populations and platforms\n\n**RASSF6** showed substantial statistical evidence:\n- **10 independent GWAS associations** with prostate cancer\n- **Very significant p-values**: 1×10⁻³¹, 9×10⁻²⁹, 4×10⁻²⁶\n\n**AFM** showed moderate evidence:\n- **2 GWAS associations** with prostate cancer\n- P-values: 5×10⁻¹⁵, 5×10⁻¹³\n\n### Literature Evidence\n\n**Strong prostate cancer literature associations found for:**\n- **CXCL1**: Papers on prostate cancer cell proliferation and bone metastasis suppression\n- **CXCL2**: Papers on myeloid landscape in prostate cancer mouse models and cancer-associated fibroblast genes\n- **CXCL8**: Papers on prostate cancer cell proliferation mechanisms\n- **PF4V1**: Papers demonstrating tumor suppressor activity in prostate cancer\n- **AFP**: Papers on prostate cancer diagnostics, treatment monitoring, and biomarker studies\n\n### Biological Plausibility\n\n**AFP (Alpha-Fetoprotein)**:\n- Well-established cancer biomarker with clinical applications\n- Involved in cancer progression, metastasis, and treatment response\n- Direct clinical relevance to prostate cancer diagnostics\n- Known role in cancer biology and tumor metabolism\n\n**RASSF6 (RAS Association Domain Family Member 6)**:\n- Known tumor suppressor gene\n- Involved in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis\n- Strong biological foundation for cancer involvement\n\n## Analysis and Interpretation\n\nWhile multiple genes showed evidence of involvement in prostate cancer biology, **AFP stands out as the most likely causal gene** based on:\n\n1. **Statistical Superiority**: AFP has by far the most extensive GWAS evidence (37 associations vs. 10 for RASSF6)\n2. **Clinical Relevance**: AFP is an established biomarker used in prostate cancer diagnostics and treatment monitoring\n3. **Biological Mechanism**: AFP's role in cancer progression and metastasis provides strong biological plausibility\n4. **Consistency**: Multiple independent studies consistently show AFP's association with prostate cancer\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**AFP** is identified as the most likely causal gene for prostate cancer in this locus, supported by:\n- Extensive statistical evidence from GWAS studies\n- Well-established clinical utility as a prostate cancer biomarker\n- Strong biological mechanism for cancer involvement\n- Consistent findings across multiple independent research studies\n\nThis conclusion is based on the convergence of statistical significance, biological plausibility, and clinical relevance, making AFP the most compelling candidate for a causal role in prostate cancer development within this genomic region.",
