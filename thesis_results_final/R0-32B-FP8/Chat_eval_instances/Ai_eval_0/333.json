Strongest statistical evidence from GWAS studies (35 diabetes associations)\n2. Extremely significant P-values (up to 4×10^-54)\n3. Association with developmental disorders matching Kabuki syndrome phenotype\n4. Appropriate genomic location within the specified locus\n\nThis finding is supported by multiple independent databases including GWAS Catalog, DisGeNET, and OMIM, providing robust evidence for COBLL1's role as the causal gene.",
