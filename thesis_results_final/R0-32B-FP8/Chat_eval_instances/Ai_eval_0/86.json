  "prompt": "Your task is to identify the gene with the strongest perturbation effect for the following research context:\n\nI hope to study the dynamic changes in gene expression that influence the production of hepatitis B virus surface antigen (Pro-HBsAg) in the HepG2-NTCP1 HBV Cas9 cell line over a 10-day period. This will help elucidate the molecular mechanisms and regulatory pathways involved in the response to HBV infection and identify potential therapeutic targets.\n\nFrom the following list of candidate genes, select the ONE gene that would have the strongest perturbation effect in this experimental context:\n\nCandidate genes: GPAT4, ID1, GOT1L1, DNAJA1, ZMYM3, FSIP1, ZCCHC14, PRDX2, MUC5B, TAZ, AMACR\n\nOutput only the gene symbol of your choice, e.g., BRCA1",
