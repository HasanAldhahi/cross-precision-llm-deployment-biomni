Direct role as the central inflammasome adaptor protein\n2. Essential function in NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated pyroptosis\n3. Critical position in connecting inflammasome components to downstream cell death pathways\n4. Well-established literature supporting its central role in inflammatory cell death processes\n\n## References\n\n[1] Central inflammasome adaptor protein ASC activates the inflammasome after transition from a soluble to an insoluble state  \n[2] Multiple studies demonstrating ASC's role in NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated pyroptosis  \n[3] Evolutionary and functional analysis of Caspase-8 and ASC interactions to drive lytic cell death (PANoptosis)  \n[4] ASC's essential role in inflammasome assembly and function  \n[5] TRAF3IP3 induces ER stress-mediated apoptosis with protective autophagy  \n[6] PAK3-R67C variation and neurological phenotypic features",
