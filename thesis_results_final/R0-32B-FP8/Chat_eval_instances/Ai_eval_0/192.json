Strong literature evidence linking CCR4 to T-cell lymphoma\n2. CCR4's role as a therapeutic target in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma\n3. The gene's involvement in T-cell biology and immune function\n4. Patient phenotypes consistent with T-cell lymphoma presentation\n\nThe combination of neurological symptoms (hypertonia, motor delay) and hemorrhage, along with CCR4's well-established role in T-cell lymphoma biology, provides compelling evidence for this gene-disease association.\n\n## Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"causal_gene\": [\"ENSG00000158290\"]}\n```",
