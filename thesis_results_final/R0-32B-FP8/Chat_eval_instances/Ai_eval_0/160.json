This syndrome is specifically caused by mutations in the **CISD2** gene (ENSG00000145354), which encodes a protein involved in iron-sulfur cluster assembly and mitochondrial function.\n\n## Evidence Summary\n\n1. **Phenotype Matching**: CISD2 mutations cause Wolfram syndrome, which includes the three hallmark features present in this patient: diabetes mellitus (HP:0003418), optic atrophy (HP:0010297), and developmental delay (HP:0002460)\n\n2. **Multi-system Involvement**: The patient's extensive neurological, growth, and metabolic phenotypes align with the known pleiotropic effects of CISD2 mutations\n\n3. **Exclusion of Other Candidates**: While other genes like SETBP1 and PROP1 showed partial phenotype matches, none captured the complete triad that defines Wolfram syndrome\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**Causal Gene**: ENSG00000145354 (CISD2)\n\nThe combination of diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy, and developmental delay in this patient strongly indicates Wolfram syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the CISD2 gene.\n\n---\n\n**References:**\n[1] Wolfram syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by diabetes insipidus, diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy, and hypothalamic dysfunction, with CISD2 being the primary causative gene in most cases.",
