The development of Trametinib resistance involves several key mechanisms including:\n\n- RAS-ERK signaling pathway reactivation\n- Alternative receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) pathway activation\n- PI3K/AKT pathway activation\n- Metabolic reprogramming (aerobic glycolysis)\n\n## Candidate Gene Analysis\n\n### Primary Candidates with Direct Pathway Relevance\n\n**DUSP10 (Dual Specificity Phosphatase 10 / MKP5)**\n- Encodes MAP kinase phosphatase-5, a negative regulator of MAP kinase pathways\n- Directly controls the MEK/ERK pathway that Trametinib targets [2]\n- Functions as a critical feedback inhibitor of MAPK signaling\n\n**KEAP1 (Kelch-Like ECH-Associated Protein 1)**\n- Negative regulator of the NRF2-KEAP1-ARE signaling pathway\n- Important for drug resistance through oxidative stress response mechanisms\n- Indirect connection to MEK/ERK pathway regulation\n\n**VHL (Von Hippel-Lindau Tumor Suppressor)**\n- Associated with cancer progression and drug resistance\n- Involved in hypoxia response and tumor development\n- No direct connection to MEK/ERK pathway regulation\n\n**MYH11 (Myosin Heavy Chain 11)**\n- Involved in cancer progression via PI3K/AKT pathway regulation\n- Secondary downstream pathway relevance\n- Less direct connection to Trametinib resistance\n\n### Secondary Candidates with Limited Relevance\n\n**GLMN, MEFV, SLC29A3, DNAJC25, POFUT1, SMUG1, KIAA1551**\n- Limited or unclear connections to cancer drug resistance mechanisms\n- Functions primarily related to other cellular processes (hyperpigmentation, ion transport, etc.)\n\n## Key Findings\n\n### Mechanistic Connection Analysis\n\nThe research demonstrates that DUSP10/MKP5 serves as a critical negative regulator of the MEK/ERK pathway [2]. This pathway is the direct target of Trametinib's mechanism of action, making DUSP10 the most mechanistically relevant candidate gene:\n\n1. **Direct Pathway Regulation**: DUSP10/MKP5 directly regulates the MEK/ERK signaling cascade that Trametinib inhibits\n2. **Negative Feedback Role**: Functions as a brake on MAP kinase signaling, controlling pathway activation\n3. **Resistance Mechanism Alignment**: Trametinib resistance involves pathway activation, and DUSP10 controls this activation through its phosphatase activity\n\n### Impact Assessment\n\nPerturbation of DUSP10 would have the strongest effect because:\n\n- **Immediate Effects**: Changes in DUSP10 activity would directly impact the cellular response to MEK inhibition\n- **Strongest Mechanistic Connection**: Represents the most direct link to Trametinib's target pathway\n- **Resistance Development**: Loss of DUSP10 function could lead to enhanced pathway activation and accelerated resistance development\n- **Therapeutic Relevance**: DUSP10 perturbation would affect the very pathway that determines Trametinib sensitivity\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**DUSP10** represents the gene with the strongest potential perturbation effect in the context of Trametinib resistance development in HCC364 lung cancer cells. Its direct regulatory role in the MEK/ERK pathway provides the most mechanistically relevant target for understanding cellular changes during drug resistance development.\n\n## References\n\n[1] Literature review of Trametinib mechanism showing its role as a MEK inhibitor targeting the RAS-ERK signaling pathway in lung cancer treatment\n\n[2] Research demonstrating DUSP10/MKP5 function as a MAP kinase phosphatase that negatively regulates MEK/ERK pathway signaling, directly controlling the pathway targeted by Trametinib",
