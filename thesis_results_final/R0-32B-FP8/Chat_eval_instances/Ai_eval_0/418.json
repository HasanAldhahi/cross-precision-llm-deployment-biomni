This phenotype specifically refers to the concentration of complement component 4 protein in neonatal blood circulation.\n\n## Methodology\nI conducted a systematic analysis using multiple approaches:\n- Literature search via PubMed for studies on neonatal C4 protein concentration\n- Database queries of UniProt for protein-gene associations\n- Analysis of OMIM databases for genetic disorders\n- Review of GWAS-related studies and their genetic associations\n\n## Key Findings\n\n### Literature Evidence\nA pivotal study was identified: **\"The correlates of neonatal complement component 3 and 4 protein concentrations with a focus on psychiatric and autoimmune disorders\"** (PMID: 38116117). This research directly examines neonatal circulating complement component concentrations, providing context-specific evidence.\n\n### Protein Function Analysis\nUniProt database queries revealed two key genes encoding complement component 4 proteins:\n\n**C4A Gene**: Encodes \"Complement C4-A\" (acidic complement C4), which serves as a precursor that gets cleaved to form the active circulating C4a and C4b proteins.\n\n**C4B Gene**: Encodes \"Complement C4-B\" (basic complement C4), which also gets cleaved to form circulating C4b protein.\n\nBoth genes produce complement component 4 proteins that circulate in blood, but they generate different isoforms with distinct functional properties.\n\n### GWAS and Clinical Evidence\nAdditional supporting evidence includes:\n- Studies showing **C4A gene copy numbers modulate serum immune protein profiles** (PMID: 41092761)\n- Research documenting **C4A variations in age-related macular degeneration** (PMID: 27090374)\n- Clinical reports of **C4B deficiency in systemic lupus erythematosus** (PMID: 1347491)\n\n### Comparative Analysis\nWhile both C4A and C4B contribute to circulating C4 proteins, several factors support C4A as the more likely causal gene:\n\n1. **Major Circulating Form**: C4A encodes the acidic form of complement component 4, which represents the predominant circulating isoform in human blood.\n\n2. **GWAS Relevance**: C4A has been directly mentioned in GWAS studies examining circulating immune protein profiles, demonstrating its relevance to quantitative protein phenotypes.\n\n3. **Functional Impact**: Variations in C4A gene copy numbers have been shown to modulate serum immune protein profiles, indicating direct control over circulating protein levels.\n\n4. **Clinical Associations**: C4A deficiency would have more direct and measurable effects on overall circulating C4 protein concentration compared to C4B deficiency.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**C4A** is identified as the most likely causal gene for neonatal circulating Complement Component 4 (C4) protein concentration. This conclusion is supported by:\n\n- Direct encoding of the major circulating C4 isoform (acidic C4)\n- Established associations with circulating protein profiles in GWAS studies\n- Functional evidence showing gene copy number variations affect serum protein levels\n- Clinical relevance to complement component deficiencies affecting circulating proteins\n\nThe evidence strongly supports C4A as the primary gene controlling neonatal circulating complement component 4 protein concentration within this genomic locus.",
