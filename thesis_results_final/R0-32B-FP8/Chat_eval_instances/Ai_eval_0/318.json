Superior GWAS association profile (690 lipid metabolism associations)\n2. Clear functional role in cholesterol homeostasis regulation\n3. ClinVar pathogenicity classifications for cholesterol disorders\n4. Extensive literature support for familial hypercholesterolemia\n\n## References\n\n[1] UniProt functional annotation for PCSK9 - crucial role in plasma cholesterol homeostasis  \n[2] PubMed literature confirming PCSK9 variants in familial hypercholesterolemia  \n[3] GWAS Catalog database query results showing PCSK9's extensive association profile  \n[4] ClinVar database pathogenicity classifications for PCSK9 variants",
