The patient has 29 phenotypes in total 2. The phenotype pattern matches Camurati-Branca syndrome 3. Camurati-Branca syndrome is caused by mutations in TGFBR1 4. TGFBR1 (ENSG00000106799) is in the candidate gene list The key phenotypes that match Camurati-Branca syndrome include: - HP:0000262 (Progressive symmetric muscle hypertrophy) - HP:0000494 (Bone abnormalities) - HP:0000520 (Intellectual disability) - HP:0000592 (Muscle hypertrophy) - HP:0000684 (Leg muscle involvement) - HP:0000944 (Progressive muscle involvement) And the candidate genes are: - RAD51D, AVP, RNASE3, LRIG2, CACNA2D1, PODXL, P4HB, PAX2, BRAF, CTNND2, HPRT1, TGFBR1 Since TGFBR1 is the known gene for Camurati-Branca syndrome and it's in the candidate list, this must be the causal gene. The requested output format is: {'causal_gene': [gene1]} So I should provide: {'causal_gene': ['ENSG00000106799']}</think> <solution> {'causal_gene': ['ENSG00000106799']} </solution>",
