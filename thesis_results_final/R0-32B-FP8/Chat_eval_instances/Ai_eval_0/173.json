[✓] Look up the HPO phenotype IDs to understand what clinical features they represent 2. [✓] Convert Ensembl gene IDs to gene symbols for analysis 3. [✓] Query databases to find associations between each candidate gene and the phenotypes 4. [✓] Analyze the phenotype-gene associations to identify the most likely causal gene 5. [✓] Provide the final answer in the required JSON format The patient presents with a phenotype pattern consistent with muscular dystrophy: - **HP:0002460**: Distal muscle weakness - **HP:0003202**: Skeletal muscle atrophy - **HP:0000762**: Decreased nerve conduction velocity - **HP:0001288**: Gait disturbance From the candidate genes, **DYSF (ENSG00000135636)** shows the strongest association with this phenotype pattern. DYSF is associated with: - Muscular dystrophy, limb-girdle, autosomal recessive 2 - Miyoshi muscular dystrophy 1 - Myopathy, distal, with anterior tibial onset These conditions are characterized by distal muscle weakness, muscle atrophy, and gait disturbances, which directly match the patient's clinical presentation. <solution> {'causal_gene': ['ENSG00000135636']} </solution>",
