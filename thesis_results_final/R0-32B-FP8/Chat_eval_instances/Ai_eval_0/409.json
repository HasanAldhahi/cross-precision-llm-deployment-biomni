Multi-trait sex score is a composite phenotype that captures sexual dimorphism across multiple traits, particularly metabolic and cardiovascular characteristics.\n\n## Methodology\n\n1. **GWAS Catalog Analysis**: Systematically searched the GWAS catalog for associations between each candidate gene and multi-trait sex score phenotype\n2. **Literature Review**: Queried PubMed for evidence of sex-specific effects and biological mechanisms for candidate genes\n3. **Statistical Evidence Evaluation**: Compared association strengths (p-values) and number of independent studies per gene\n\n## Key Findings\n\n### GWAS Association Evidence\n- **CETP**: 59 independent associations with multi-trait sex score (p-values ranging from 1×10^-30 to 6×10^-161)\n- **APOA5**: 12 associations (p-values ranging from 3×10^-53 to 7×10^-37)\n- **APOA4**: 6 associations (p-values ranging from 1×10^-33 to 2×10^-14)\n- **ZPR1**: 7 associations (p-values ranging from 3×10^-88 to 6×10^-33)\n- **APOC3**: 5 associations (p-values ranging from 6×10^-33 to 2×10^-14)\n- **BUD13**: 37 associations (p-values ranging from 5×10^-36 to 3×10^-26)\n- **SIK3**: 8 associations (p-values ranging from 1×10^-19 to 1×10^-14)\n- **APOA1**: 2 associations (p-values ranging from 3×10^-18 to 1×10^-14)\n\n### Literature Evidence\n- Multiple studies documenting **sex-specific effects of CETP** on lipid metabolism [1]\n- Evidence of **gender-specific polymorphism effects** in CETP rs708272 variant [2]\n- Research showing **sexual dimorphism in CETP's regulation** of metabolic processes [3]\n\n### Biological Rationale\nCETP encodes cholesteryl ester transfer protein, which:\n- Transfers cholesteryl esters between HDL and other lipoproteins\n- Plays a central role in reverse cholesterol transport\n- Is known to exhibit sex-specific effects on lipid profiles\n- Shows differential regulation in males vs females\n- Has documented sexually dimorphic DNA methylation patterns\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**CETP is the most likely causal gene** for the Multi-trait sex score phenotype based on:\n1. **Strongest statistical evidence**: Most associations (59) and most significant p-values\n2. **Biological plausibility**: Well-documented sex-specific effects on lipid metabolism\n3. **Convergence of evidence**: Multiple independent studies showing consistent associations\n4. **Mechanistic basis**: Central role in cholesterol metabolism with known sexual dimorphism\n\n---\n\n### References\n[1] Sex-specific effects of CETP on perivascular adipose tissue - Function (Oxford, England)\n[2] Gender-specific effects of CETP rs708272 polymorphism on lipid levels - Medicine  \n[3] Sexually dimorphic DNA methylation in cardiometabolic health - Maturitas",
