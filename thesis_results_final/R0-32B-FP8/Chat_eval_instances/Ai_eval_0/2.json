Statistical Superiority [1]\n- Multiple genome-wide significant associations (p < 5e-8)\n- Most significant p-values include 0.0 and 9e-86\n- Consistent replication across different populations (Japanese, European, Indian Asian, African American)\n\n### 2. Biological Relevance [2]\n- CASR gene encodes the calcium-sensing receptor\n- Direct mechanistic role in calcium homeostasis\n- Strong biological plausibility for calcium level regulation\n\n### 3. Methodological Strength [3]\n- Replication across independent studies\n- Consistent effect sizes indicating robust association\n- Multiple research groups converging on same variant\n\n## Conclusion\n\nrs1801725 represents the most promising variant for further examination based on its exceptional statistical significance, strong biological plausibility through the CASR gene, and consistent replication across multiple populations and studies.\n\n---\n\n**References:**\n[1] Multiple GWAS studies showing genome-wide significant associations with calcium levels  \n[2] CASR gene encodes the calcium-sensing receptor, directly involved in calcium homeostasis  \n[3] Consistent associations across different populations and research groups",
