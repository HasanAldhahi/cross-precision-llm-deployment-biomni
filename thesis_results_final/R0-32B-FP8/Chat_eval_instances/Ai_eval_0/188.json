[✓] Load DisGeNET data for additional gene-phenotype associations 4. [✓] Convert Ensembl gene IDs to gene symbols if needed 5. [✓] Analyze which candidate genes are associated with the given phenotypes 6. [✓] Identify the most likely causal gene based on association strength The patient presents with a constellation of phenotypes including: - Neurological: Intellectual disability, seizures, muscle weakness, Babinski sign - Developmental: Growth delay, failure to thrive - Dental: Hypodontia, abnormal dental enamel morphology - Other: Hypertension, urinary hesitancy, dysuria, vertigo, loss of voice From the candidate genes analyzed: - **ATRX** (ENSG00000085224) is associated with intellectual disability-hypotonic facies syndrome and alpha-thalassemia/impaired intellectual development syndrome - ANO5 is associated with muscular dystrophy but doesn't explain the full neurological constellation - OFD1 is associated with X-linked syndromes including intellectual disability but is less specific - WNK1 is associated with neuropathy but doesn't explain the complete phenotype pattern The neurological and developmental phenotype pattern (intellectual disability, seizures, growth delay, failure to thrive, muscle weakness) is most consistent with ATRX-related disorders. <solution> {'causal_gene': ['ENSG00000085224']} </solution>",
