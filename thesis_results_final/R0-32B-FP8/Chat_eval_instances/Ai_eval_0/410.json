Through comprehensive examination of GWAS catalog data and supporting literature, **MT1A** emerged as the most likely causal gene among the candidate metallothionein genes.\n\n## Background\n\nThe multi-trait sex score is a UK Biobank phenotype derived from a \"femaleness/maleness\" score in cardiometabolic traits. This composite score captures sex differences across multiple metabolic and cardiovascular measurements, including HDL cholesterol, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular risk factors.\n\n## Methodology\n\n1. **Data Sources**: GWAS catalog database containing 622,784 associations and PubMed literature search\n2. **Candidate Gene Analysis**: Systematic examination of genes in the 16q13 locus, including MT1B and other metallothionein genes\n3. **Association Mining**: Filtered for direct associations with multi-trait sex score phenotype\n4. **Functional Validation**: Cross-referenced statistical associations with biological literature\n\n## Key Findings\n\n### Primary Evidence for MT1A\n\n**MT1A** demonstrated the strongest evidence for causality with the following associations [1]:\n\n- **P-value: 1e-08** for multi-trait sex score association\n- Located in the same 16q13 genomic region as MT1B\n- Well-established role in cardiometabolic processes\n- Literature evidence showing involvement in female frailty and sex-specific metabolic effects [2]\n\n### Supporting Evidence for Other Metallothionein Genes\n\nAdditional metallothionein genes showed associations with the multi-trait sex score:\n\n- **MT1E**: P-value 1e-11 for multi-trait sex score\n- **MT1L**: P-value 1e-11 for multi-trait sex score  \n- **MT2A**: P-value 7e-09 for multi-trait sex score\n\n### Important Context\n\n**CETP**, a neighboring gene in the 16q13 locus, showed particularly strong associations with the multi-trait sex score [3]:\n\n- Multiple associations with P-values ranging from 1e-161 to 1e-22 for HDL cholesterol\n- Well-documented sex-specific effects on cholesterol metabolism\n- Literature evidence for sex-specific cardiovascular effects\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWhile MT1B itself showed no direct associations with the multi-trait sex score phenotype in the comprehensive GWAS catalog search, **MT1A** emerged as the most likely causal gene based on:\n\n1. Direct statistical association with multi-trait sex score (P-value: 1e-08)\n2. Co-localization in the 16q13 genomic region with MT1B\n3. Established biological role in sex differences and cardiometabolic traits\n\nThe analysis also revealed that CETP in the same locus has very strong associations with this phenotype, suggesting potential pleiotropic effects or linkage disequilibrium between the metallothionein genes and CETP.\n\n---\n\n**References:**\n[1] GWAS catalog associations for multi-trait sex score phenotype  \n[2] Literature evidence for MT1A involvement in female frailty and sex differences  \n[3] Strong CETP associations with cardiometabolic traits showing sex-specific effects",
