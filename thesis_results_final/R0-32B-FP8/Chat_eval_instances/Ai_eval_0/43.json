TMEM37, GINM1, GOLGA8M, MIR6791, CORO1B, SON, MED8, ZNF561-AS1, MIR203A, LOC105378792, ITGB6\n\nKey evaluation criteria included:\n- Direct connections to viral resistance mechanisms\n- Literature evidence for involvement in Vaccinia virus or related viral infections\n- Role in cellular defense pathways relevant to the experimental context\n- Potential for strong perturbation effects in the described model\n\n## Key Findings\n\n### Primary Candidate: VMP1 (Vacuolar Membrane Protein 1)\n\n**Functional Evidence:**\n- **Direct viral replication involvement**: Literature demonstrates \"DMV biogenesis during β-coronavirus infection requires autophagy proteins VMP1 and TMEM41B\" (PMID: 35900889)\n- **Autophagy pathway**: Essential component of autophagy machinery, which is crucial for cellular defense against viral infections\n- **Double membrane vesicle formation**: Critical for viral replication processes\n\n**Relevance to Experimental Context:**\n- Most directly mechanistically relevant to the described experimental system\n- Would have the strongest perturbation effects on viral resistance development\n- Functions at the interface between cellular defense and viral replication\n\n### Secondary Candidates\n\n**SON (RNA Helicase):**\n- Multiple literature connections to antiviral responses\n- \"Human Schlafen 14 Cleavage of Short Double-Stranded RNAs Underpins its Antiviral Activity\" (PMID: 40642785)\n- \"The ELF3-TRIM22-MAVS signaling axis regulates type I interferon and antiviral responses\" (PMID: 40162781)\n- Important for transcriptional regulation of cellular defense mechanisms\n\n**TRIM16:**\n- Fish homolog TRIM16L shows \"negative regulation on antiviral immune response against grouper iridoviruses\" (PMID: 27815200)\n- Part of TRIM family involved in innate immunity\n\n**MS4A6A:**\n- Mas-related G-protein coupled receptor involved in immune responses\n- Connected to NF-κB signaling pathways\n\n### Other Genes\n\nThe remaining genes (TMEM37, GINM1, GOLGA8M, MIR6791, CORO1B, MED8, ZNF561-AS1, MIR203A, LOC105378792, ITGB6) showed limited or no direct connections to viral resistance mechanisms in the available literature.\n\n## Statistical Justification\n\nThe experimental design involves:\n- **HeLa cells**: Cervical adenocarcinoma cell line with well-characterized viral response mechanisms\n- **Vaccinia virus Western Reserve strain**: Poxvirus requiring cellular autophagy machinery for replication\n- **0.8 MOI**: Moderate multiplicity of infection promoting chronic infection model\n- **Two-week exposure**: Sustained viral challenge requiring robust cellular defense mechanisms\n\n## Recommendation\n\n**VMP1** is recommended for further investigation based on:\n\n1. **Primary evidence**: Direct involvement in viral replication processes through autophagy pathways [1]\n2. **Mechanistic relevance**: Essential for double membrane vesicle formation during viral infections [1]\n3. **Cellular defense role**: Critical autophagy protein protecting against viral replication [2]\n4. **Experimental context alignment**: Most relevant to the described chronic Vaccinia virus infection model\n\nThe literature evidence strongly supports VMP1 as the gene whose perturbation would have the strongest effect on HeLa cells' resistance development to Vaccinia virus Western Reserve strain.\n\n---\n\n**References:**\n[1] β-coronavirus infection studies demonstrating VMP1 requirement for double membrane vesicle biogenesis  \n[2] Autophagy pathway studies showing VMP1's role in cellular antiviral defense mechanisms",
