Based on my search through the Ensembl REST API, I found that: 1. The syndrome name is \"scalp-ear-nipple syndrome\" 2. The OMIM ID is 613420 3. The associated gene is KCTD1 (ENSG00000134504) 4. The syndrome is associated with the three phenotypes mentioned in the question: - HP:0002561 (Seizure) - HP:0001057 (Intellectual disability) - HP:0000598 (Growth hormone deficiency) The syndrome is caused by mutations in the KCTD1 gene, which is located on chromosome 18 in humans. Let me provide the final answer in the requested JSON format.</think> <solution> {\"syndrome\": \"scalp-ear-nipple syndrome\", \"OMIM_ID\": \"613420\"} </solution>",
