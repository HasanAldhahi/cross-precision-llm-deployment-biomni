Through systematic querying of the OpenTargets API, **only GCST90093303** was found to meet all criteria, with 11,292 cases and direct associations with both colorectal cancer and polyp of large intestine.\n\n## Methodology\n\nThe analysis involved:\n1. Systematic querying of the OpenTargets GraphQL API for each provided study ID\n2. Evaluation of disease associations for each study\n3. Assessment of sample size (nCases) and relevance to colorectal cancer/neoplasms\n4. Validation of API query structure and field availability\n\n## Results\n\n### Study ID Analysis Summary\n\n| Study ID | Status | Cases | Disease Associations | Relevance |\n|----------|--------|-------|---------------------|-----------|\n| **GCST90093303** | **Valid** | **11,292** | **Colorectal cancer, Polyp of large intestine** | **High** |\n| GCST90006576 | Invalid | N/A | No data found | None |\n| GCST90011784 | Valid | 0 | Chemotherapy-induced cytotoxicity | Low |\n| GCST90012121 | Invalid | N/A | No data found | None |\n| GCST90012755 | Valid | 0 | Triglyceride measurement | Low |\n\n### Detailed Findings\n\n**GCST90093303** [1]\n- **Sample size**: 11,292 cases (substantial for GWAS analysis)\n- **Disease associations**: \n  - Colorectal cancer (MONDO_0005575)\n  - Polyp of large intestine (MONDO_0021392)\n- **Relevance**: Direct match to both \"colorectal cancer\" and \"colorectal neoplasms\" criteria\n\n**Other Studies** [2]\n- **GCST90006576**: No data returned from API query\n- **GCST90011784**: Associated with chemotherapy-induced cytotoxicity (EFO_0010978)\n- **GCST90012121**: No data returned from API query  \n- **GCST90012755**: Associated with triglyceride measurement (EFO_0004530)\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**GCST90093303** is the only study ID from the provided list that meets the specified criteria of being associated with colorectal cancer or colorectal neoplasms. It demonstrates:\n- High statistical power with 11,292 cases\n- Direct associations with both colorectal cancer and large intestine polyps\n- Valid API accessibility with complete data\n\nThe other four study IDs either returned no data (GCST90006576, GCST90012121) or were associated with unrelated phenotypes (chemotherapy effects, triglycerides).\n\n## References\n\n[1] GCST90093303: OpenTargets study database, accessed via GraphQL API, shows associations with MONDO_0005575 (colorectal cancer) and MONDO_0021392 (polyp of large intestine)\n\n[2] Other study IDs: Systematic API queries revealed either data unavailability or associations with non-colorectal phenotypes",
