While the recognition sequence GATATAC is not actually present at position 5 in the given reference sequence, the question asks for the fragment lengths that would be produced if a cut were created at position 5. Among all options, only Option D provides a valid digestion pattern that could potentially include position 5 as a cut site while maintaining the correct total sequence length.",

  "prompt": "Your task is to identify the gene with the strongest perturbation effect for the following research context:\n\nI hope to study the temporal expression and regulation of genes involved in phagocytosis in the U-937 lymphoma cell line over a period of 5 days. This timecourse experiment aims to identify key genes and their expression patterns that facilitate phagocytosis, providing insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying this crucial cellular process.\n\nFrom the following list of candidate genes, select the ONE gene that would have the strongest perturbation effect in this experimental context:\n\nCandidate genes: NHLRC2, MRPL43, PSMB3, HRASLS5, CALB2, RSPRY1, GUCY2C, KPNA2, PYGM, SMARCC1, CCDC174\n\nOutput only the gene symbol of your choice, e.g., BRCA1",
