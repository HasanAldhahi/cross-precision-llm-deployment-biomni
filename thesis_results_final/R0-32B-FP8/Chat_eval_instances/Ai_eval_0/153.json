Given that the candidate gene ENSG00000154864 corresponds to PIEZO2, and PIEZO2 is associated with arthrogryposis conditions that can include multiple congenital anomalies affecting musculoskeletal, neurological, and other systems, this seems like the most likely causal gene. Let me provide the final answer.</think> Based on my comprehensive analysis of the patient's phenotypes and candidate genes, I can now provide the answer. **Plan Update:** 1. [✓] Convert Ensembl gene IDs to gene symbols using the Ensembl API 2. [✓] Query phenotype data lake to understand what each HP term means 3. [✓] Load gene-disease associations from DisGeNET to map genes to diseases 4. [✓] Query Monarch Initiative API to match phenotypes with gene-disease associations 5. [✓] Analyze which candidate gene has the strongest association with the patient's phenotype profile 6. [✓] Output the result in JSON format The patient has phenotypes including scoliosis, cleft palate, Chiari malformation, short stature, and potentially other congenital anomalies. The candidate gene ENSG00000154864 corresponds to PIEZO2, which is associated with multiple arthrogryposis conditions that can include complex multi-system disorders affecting musculoskeletal, neurological, and other systems. This constellation of phenotypes is consistent with PIEZO2-related arthrogryposis syndromes. <solution> {'causal_gene': ['ENSG00000154864']} </solution>",
