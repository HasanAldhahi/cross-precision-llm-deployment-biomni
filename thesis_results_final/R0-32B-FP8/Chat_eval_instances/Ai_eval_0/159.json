Systematic interpretation of HPO terms from the provided phenotype list\n2. Conversion of Ensembl gene IDs to gene symbols using comprehensive gene annotation databases\n3. Cross-referencing candidate genes with established gene-disease associations from OMIM and DisGeNET databases\n4. Pattern matching between patient phenotypes and known genetic syndrome manifestations\n\n## Key Findings\n\n### CHRNG (ENSG00000196811) - Primary Candidate\n**Associated Conditions:**\n- Multiple pterygium syndrome, lethal type (OMIM: 253290)\n- Escobar syndrome (OMIM: 265000)\n\n**Phenotype Match:**\n- ✓ Increased skull ossification (characteristic feature of Escobar syndrome)\n- ✓ Cranial nerve paralysis (neurological component)\n- ✓ Peripheral neuropathy (neurological component)  \n- ✓ CNS atrophy and degeneration (progressive neurological deterioration)\n- ✓ Hearing impairment (sensorineural hearing loss component)\n- ✓ Cerebral cortical atrophy (neurological progression)\n- ✓ Corpus callosum abnormalities (brain structural changes)\n\n### Alternative Candidates Considered\n**FRAS1 (ENSG00000138759) & GRIP1 (ENSG00000155974):**\n- Associated with Fraser syndrome (OMIM: 219000, 617667)\n- Primarily involve respiratory and cardiac abnormalities\n- **X** Poor phenotype match - lack the specific bone and progressive neurological features\n\n**SIX1 (ENSG00000126778):**\n- Associated with Branchiootic syndrome and deafness\n- **X** Insufficient bone development phenotypes to explain patient presentation\n\n**OSTM1 (ENSG00000081087):**\n- Associated with osteopetrosis (OMIM: 259720)\n- **X** Characterized by increased bone density rather than progressive ossification pattern seen\n\n## Clinical Significance\nThe phenotype constellation of increased skull ossification combined with progressive neurological deterioration is highly pathognomonic for **Escobar syndrome** or **Multiple pterygium syndrome**, both of which are caused by mutations in the CHRNG gene.\n\nCHRNG encodes the acetylcholine receptor gamma subunit, and mutations in this gene disrupt neuromuscular transmission while also affecting bone development pathways, explaining the unique combination of neurological and skeletal phenotypes observed in this patient.\n\n## Conclusion\n**ENSG00000196811 (CHRNG)** is identified as the causal gene based on:\n1. Perfect phenotype-syndrome alignment with Escobar syndrome\n2. Comprehensive database evidence from OMIM associations\n3. Systematic exclusion of other candidate genes through phenotype comparison\n\n### Final Answer\n```json\n{'causal_gene': ['ENSG00000196811']}\n```",
