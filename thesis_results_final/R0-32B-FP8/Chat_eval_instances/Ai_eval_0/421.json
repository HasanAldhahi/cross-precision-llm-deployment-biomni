Direct experimental evidence linking GYS2 variants to epilepsy\n2. Biologically plausible mechanism through glucose metabolism disruption\n3. Specificity for seizure susceptibility compared to other locus genes\n\n---\n\n### References\n[1] PMID: 37574425 - Direct association of GYS2 biallelic variants with suspected epilepsy\n[2] PMID: 32202309 - LDHA upregulation in temporal lobe epilepsy models  \n[3] PMID: 40570636 - SLCO1C1 involvement in cerebral cavernous malformation",
