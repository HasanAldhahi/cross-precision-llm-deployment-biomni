The analysis included:\n\n1. **Direct GWAS Catalog Query**: Searched for Bradykinin-related studies and associations\n2. **Variant-Specific Analysis**: Examined each of the 11 candidate variants individually\n3. **Statistical Prioritization**: Ranked associations by p-value significance\n4. **Literature Validation**: Searched PubMed for additional validation\n\n## Key Findings\n\n### Primary Association Identified\n\n**rs5030062** is the only variant from the candidate list with a direct association to Bradykinin-related phenotypes (1).\n\nThe association details are as follows:\n- **Phenotype**: Bradykinin, des-arg 9 levels\n- **P-value**: 6×10⁻¹³ (highly significant)\n- **Effect size (Beta)**: 0.072\n- **Mapped genes**: HRG-AS1, KNG1\n- **Confidence level**: Strong (direct phenotype match)\n\n### Candidate Variant Analysis Results\n\n**Method 1**: Direct GWAS Catalog query for Bradykinin returned 11 total associations, with only 1 matching our candidate list (9.1% hit rate).\n\n**Method 2**: Literature search via PubMed returned no papers containing GWAS associations for Bradykinin with the candidate variants.\n\n**Method 3**: Comprehensive database analysis of 46,634 cholesterol/lipid-related associations found no connections to rs5030062 or other candidate variants.\n\n## Statistical Significance Assessment\n\nThe identified association (P = 6×10⁻¹³) demonstrates:\n- Genome-wide significance (P < 5×10⁻⁶)\n- Strong statistical evidence for association\n- Top-tier ranking among all potential associations\n\n## Biological Relevance\n\nThe mapped genes HRG-AS1 and KNG1 are biologically relevant to Bradykinin metabolism:\n- **KNG1**: Encodes kininogen, the precursor protein to Bradykinin\n- **HRG-AS1**: Long non-coding RNA potentially regulating kininogen expression\n\n## Recommendation\n\n**rs5030062** is recommended as the most promising variant for further examination based on:\n- Unique association with Bradykinin-related phenotype among candidates\n- Highly significant statistical association (P = 6×10⁻¹³)\n- Biological plausibility through KNG1 gene mapping\n- Strong potential for functional relevance in Bradykinin metabolism\n\n## Limitations and Considerations\n\n- Limited number of associations found (n=1)\n- Potential for additional associations with broader phenotype definitions\n- Need for functional validation of the observed association\n\n---\n\n*Analysis conducted using GWAS Catalog database with systematic evaluation of all candidate variants against Bradykinin-related phenotypes.*\n\n(1) Association data source: GWAS Catalog, P-value: 6×10⁻¹³, Mapped genes: HRG-AS1, KNG1",
