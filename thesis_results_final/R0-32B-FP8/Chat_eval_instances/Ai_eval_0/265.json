  "last_200_tokens": "is clear: the patient has phenotypes including obesity (HP:0001513) and the candidate gene MID1 is known to be associated with Opitz GBBB syndrome (OMIM: 300000). This matches the known medical literature where MID1 mutations cause Opitz GBBB syndrome, which can include obesity as one of the phenotypic features. Let me provide the final solution.</think> Based on my systematic analysis: **Updated Plan:** 1. [✓] Look up the HPO phenotype descriptions from the provided hp.obo file 2. [✓] Convert the Ensembl gene ID to a gene symbol using the gene_info.parquet database 3. [✓] Query disease databases (OMIM, ClinVar, Monarch) to find diseases associated with this gene and these phenotypes 4. [✓] Match the phenotypes with known diseases to find the most likely diagnosis 5. [✓] Return the result in the required JSON format **Analysis Summary:** - Patient phenotypes include HP:0001513 (Obesity) and other HPO terms - Candidate gene ENSG00000101871 corresponds to MID1 - From the OMIM database, MID1 is directly associated with \"Opitz GBBB syndrome, 300000 (3), X-linked recessive\" - The phenotype of obesity (HP:0001513) is consistent with Opitz GBBB syndrome - The OMIM ID 300000 matches the disease associated with the MID1 gene <solution> {\"disease_name\": \"Opitz GBBB syndrome\", \"OMIM_ID\": \"300000\"} </solution>",
