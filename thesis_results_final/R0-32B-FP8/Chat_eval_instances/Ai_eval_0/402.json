GWAS Catalog Analysis\n- **CETP** showed **38 independent associations** with the multi-trait sum score phenotype across multiple UK Biobank studies\n- Association p-values ranged from **7.999999999999999e-30 to 9e-12**, indicating extremely strong statistical significance\n- CETP appeared both as a single gene and in combination with HERPUD1 (HERPUD1-CETP) in the mapped gene column\n- All associations originated from the same UK Biobank study: \"The genetics of a 'femaleness/maleness' score in cardiometabolic traits in the UK biobank\"\n\n### 2. Gene Function Analysis\n- CETP encodes **Cholesteryl Ester Transfer Protein**, which is directly involved in:\n  - Cholesterol metabolism\n  - Lipid transfer between HDL and other lipoproteins\n  - HDL cholesterol levels and lipid profile regulation\n- This protein plays a central role in cardiometabolic trait regulation through cholesterol metabolism\n\n### 3. Comparative Analysis with Other Genes\n- **HERPUD1**: 4 associations with multi-trait sum score\n- **ABCG1**: 2 associations with multi-trait sum score  \n- **ABCG4**: 2 associations with multi-trait sum score\n- **Other genes** (MCF2L, PAXIP1, etc.): 1 association or none\n- CETP showed by far the strongest and most consistent associations\n\n### 4. Biological Relevance\n- Multi-trait sum score represents a composite score of cardiometabolic traits\n- CETP's central role in cholesterol and lipid metabolism makes it the most biologically plausible causal gene\n- Literature confirms CETP's involvement in cardiometabolic traits and cardiovascular resilience\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**CETP** is the most likely causal gene for the Multi-trait sum score GWAS phenotype based on:\n- Highest frequency of associations (38) with this specific phenotype\n- Most significant p-values across independent samples\n- Direct biological function in cardiometabolic trait regulation\n- Consistent appearance across multiple UK Biobank studies examining the same phenotype\n- Extensive literature support for CETP's role in cardiovascular and metabolic phenotypes",
