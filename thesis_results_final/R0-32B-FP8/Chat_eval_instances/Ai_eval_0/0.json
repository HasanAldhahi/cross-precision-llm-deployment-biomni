Strongest statistical associations with calcium levels\n2. Most consistent replication across independent studies\n3. Highest biological relevance through CASR gene mapping\n4. Most comprehensive evidence profile among all candidate variants\n\nThis variant should be prioritized for functional studies, replication in additional cohorts, and mechanistic investigations into its role in calcium metabolism and homeostasis.",
