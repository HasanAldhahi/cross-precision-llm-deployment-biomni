Systematic PubMed literature searches for each gene in the locus\n2. GWAS catalog queries for liver neoplasm associations\n3. OMIM database analysis for known disease associations\n4. Functional pathway analysis for cancer relevance\n\n## Key Findings\n\n### Primary Candidate: CYP2A6\n**CYP2A6** showed the strongest evidence for causal involvement in hepatocellular carcinoma:\n\n- **Direct mechanistic evidence**: CYP2A6 suppresses hepatocellular carcinoma through inhibition of the SRC/Wnt/β-Catenin signaling pathway [1]\n- **Biomarker potential**: Associated with macrophage polarization and serves as a potential biomarker for hepatocellular carcinoma [2]\n- **Metabolic pathway involvement**: Plays a role in retinol metabolism pathways relevant to liver cancer development [3]\n- **Multiple independent studies**: Several recent publications specifically linking CYP2A6 to hepatocellular carcinoma pathogenesis\n\n### Secondary Candidates with Supporting Evidence\n\n**AXL** showed significant involvement in liver cancer through:\n- AXL signaling pathway inhibition affecting hepatocellular carcinoma progression\n- Role as a receptor tyrosine kinase in cancer progression\n- Studies on targeting AXL for liver cancer treatment\n\n**TGFB1** demonstrated connections through:\n- TGFB1/Smad/Nrf2 signaling pathway regulating liver cancer\n- Key role in liver regeneration and cancer processes\n- Multiple studies on its involvement in hepatocellular carcinoma\n\n### Supporting Literature Evidence\n\nThe literature search revealed several important studies:\n- \"CYP2A6 suppresses hepatocellular carcinoma via inhibiting SRC/Wnt/β-Catenin pathway\" (PMID: 40069491)\n- \"DNA methylation and gene expression profiling reveal potential association of retinol metabolism related genes with hepatocellular carcinoma development\" (PMID: 39193514)\n- \"CAPG Regulates Doxorubicin Resistance in Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cells via TGFB1/Smad/Nrf2 Signalling Pathway\" (PMID: 40982354)\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**CYP2A6** is identified as the most likely causal gene for Liver Neoplasms (HP:0002561) based on its direct mechanistic involvement in hepatocellular carcinoma pathogenesis, clear functional connections to liver cancer, and potential as a biomarker in liver neoplasm research.\n\n---\n\n**References:**\n[1] Acta pharmacologica Sinica (PMID: 40069491) - CYP2A6 suppresses hepatocellular carcinoma through SRC/Wnt/β-Catenin pathway inhibition  \n[2] FEBS open bio (PMID: 33455085) - CYP2A6 association with macrophage polarization in hepatocellular carcinoma  \n[3] PeerJ (PMID: 39193514) - DNA methylation studies showing retinol metabolism genes' association with hepatocellular carcinoma",
