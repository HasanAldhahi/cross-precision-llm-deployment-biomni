This analysis evaluated 29 genes in the locus to identify the most likely causal gene through systematic examination of GWAS associations and biological functions.\n\n## Key Findings\n\n### Primary Evidence for MT3\n\n**MT3** emerged as the strongest candidate based on multiple lines of evidence:\n\n- **Unique Sex-Related Association**: Among all 29 genes in the locus, MT3 was the only gene with direct sex-related associations in the GWAS catalog\n  - Association with \"body mass index x sex x age interaction\" (p-value: 5×10⁻²⁶)\n  - This represents the strongest statistical evidence for sex-related effects\n\n- **Neurological Function**: MT3 encodes Metallothionein 3, which is brain-specific and involved in:\n  - Neuronal development and dendritic arborization regulation [1]\n  - Calcium-dependent zinc homeostasis in neurons [2]\n  - Neuroprotective functions through oxidative stress regulation [3]\n\n- **Biological Plausibility**: As a brain-specific metallothionein, MT3's role in neuronal development and zinc regulation provides a mechanistic basis for influencing complex sex-related traits.\n\n### Supporting Evidence from GWAS Catalog\n\nAnalysis of the GWAS catalog revealed:\n- **2,600 associations** with Multi-trait sex score phenotype\n- **MT3** showed the only direct sex-related association among all locus genes\n- Other genes primarily associated with metabolic traits (HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, BMI) but lacked sex-specific associations\n\n### Alternative Candidates\n\n**CETP** showed strong associations with metabolic traits but lacked direct sex-related associations. While metabolic traits can show sex differences, CETP did not demonstrate the specific sex-related genetic interactions seen with MT3.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**MT3 (Metallothionein 3)** is the most likely causal gene for Multi-trait sex score based on:\n1. Unique direct association with sex-related traits (BMI x sex x age interaction)\n2. Brain-specific neurological functions relevant to complex traits\n3. Extensive representation in Multi-trait sex score associations\n4. Biological mechanism involving zinc homeostasis and neuronal development\n\nThe convergence of statistical evidence from GWAS associations and biological function in brain development strongly supports MT3 as the causal gene for this phenotype.\n\n---\n\n### References\n\n[1] Metallothionein III Mediates Ca(2+)-Dependent Zn(2+) Spikes to Inhibit Dendritic Arborization - *Journal of Neuroscience*\n\n[2] Growth inhibitory factor/metallothionein-3 is a sulfane sulfur-binding protein - *eLife*\n\n[3] Unique expression and critical role of metallothionein 3 in the control of osteoclastogenesis and osteoporosis - *Experimental & Molecular Medicine*",
