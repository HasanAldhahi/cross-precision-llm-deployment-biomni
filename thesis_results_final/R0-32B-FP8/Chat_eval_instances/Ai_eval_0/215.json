Key pathogenic mechanisms include:\n- Inflammatory damage to vessel walls\n- Thrombosis and blood clot formation\n- Multi-system involvement (kidneys, lungs, skin)\n- Kidney manifestations including glomerulonephritis\n\n## Gene Analysis Results\n\n### SERPINC1 (Primary Candidate)\n\n**Gene Function:** Encodes antithrombin III, a crucial natural anticoagulant that regulates blood coagulation by inhibiting thrombin and other serine proteases.\n\n**Supporting Evidence:**\n- Multiple studies demonstrate SERPINC1 mutations cause hereditary antithrombin deficiency [1]\n- Antithrombin deficiency leads to thrombophilia and increased risk of venous thromboembolism [2]\n- Direct evidence shows \"Henoch-Schönlein Purpura Nephritis and Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis Due to Hereditary Deficiency of Antithrombin III\" [3]\n- Thrombosis is a key pathogenic feature of microscopic polyangiitis\n- Coagulation dysregulation contributes to vascular inflammation and damage\n\n### MS4A Gene Family (Secondary Candidates)\n\n**Gene Functions:** Membrane-spanning 4-domains subfamily A genes primarily involved in immune cell function, including:\n- MS4A1: B-cell activation and immunodeficiency\n- MS4A2: FcεRI pathway and allergic responses  \n- MS4A3-MS4A8: Various immune and inflammatory pathways\n\n**Analysis Outcome:** While these genes influence immune function, no direct associations with vasculitis or thrombosis were identified in the literature review.\n\n### Other Genes in Locus\n\n**Analysis Outcome:** Most remaining genes (CCDC86, OOSP2, OOSP4A, OOSP4B, PRPF19, PTGDR2, SLC15A3, TMEM109, TMEM132A, ZP1) showed no clear disease associations with microscopic polyangiitis. Functions appear unrelated to vascular pathogenesis.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**Likely Causal Gene: SERPINC1**\n\nThe evidence strongly supports SERPINC1 as the causal gene based on:\n\n1. **Direct mechanistic connection** between antithrombin deficiency and thrombosis, a key feature of microscopic polyangiitis\n2. **Documented cases** of antithrombin deficiency causing purpura and thrombotic complications\n3. **Biological plausibility** - coagulation dysregulation contributes to vascular inflammation and damage in microscopic polyangiitis\n4. **Lack of competing evidence** - other genes in the locus showed no direct associations with vasculitis pathogenesis\n\n## References\n\n[1] Multiple studies demonstrating SERPINC1 pathogenic variants causing hereditary antithrombin deficiency in Chinese thrombophilia cohorts\n\n[2] Genotype-phenotype correlation studies showing SERPINC1 variants lead to thrombophilia and venous thromboembolism\n\n[3] Case reports documenting Henoch-Schönlein purpura nephritis and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis due to hereditary antithrombin III deficiency",
