[✓] Convert HPO phenotype codes to human-readable descriptions (completed) 2. [✓] Identify the candidate genes from the Ensembl IDs (completed) 3. [✓] Query gene-disease associations from available databases (completed) 4. [✓] Match phenotypes with gene associations to determine the most likely causal gene (completed) 5. [✓] Return the result in the specified JSON format (completed) **Analysis Summary:** The patient presents with a constellation of genitourinary system abnormalities including: - Kidney abnormalities (HP:0000737) - Urinary system abnormalities (HP:0001300) - Genital system abnormalities (HP:0002063) - Reproductive system abnormalities (HP:0002493) - Proteinuria (HP:0002167) - Male hypogonadism (HP:0000528) From the candidate genes: - **SLC25A3** (ENSG00000075415): Associated with kidney failure, diabetes, and appears in multiple genitourinary-related disorders in DisGeNET - **ZNF711** (ENSG00000147180): Primarily associated with X-linked mental retardation - **USP14** (ENSG00000101557): Associated with elliptocytosis and various cancers The genitourinary phenotype pattern (kidney dysfunction, bladder abnormalities, reproductive system issues) strongly aligns with SLC25A3-associated disorders. SLC25A3 encodes a mitochondrial carrier protein involved in taurine transport, and mutations can cause taurine deficiency leading to kidney dysfunction and reproductive issues. <solution> {'causal_gene': ['ENSG00000075415']} </solution>",
