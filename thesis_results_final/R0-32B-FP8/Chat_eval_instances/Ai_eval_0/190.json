The patient's phenotype pattern is characteristic of LIG4 syndrome, which is a DNA repair disorder.</think> Based on my systematic analysis of the patient's phenotypes and candidate genes: **Updated Plan:** 1. [✓] Convert HPO terms to human-readable phenotype descriptions (completed) 2. [✓] Convert Ensembl gene IDs to gene symbols (completed) 3. [✓] Query disease-gene associations using available tools (completed) 4. [✓] Analyze which candidate gene has the strongest association with the given phenotypes (completed) 5. [✓] Provide the final answer (completed) The patient presents with a constellation of 26 phenotypes including: - Skeletal abnormalities (platyspondyly, brachydactyly, bowing of long bones, kyphosis, micromelia, abnormal metaphysis morphology) - Neurological features (macrocephaly, large fontanelles, hypotonia, hydrocephalus) - Cardiovascular abnormalities (patent ductus arteriosus, atrial septal defect) - Growth and developmental abnormalities (frontal bossing, redundant skin, glucose intolerance) Among the 18 candidate genes, LIG4 (ENSG00000174405) shows the strongest phenotypic correlation with 10+ specific features matching LIG4 syndrome, a DNA repair disorder characterized by similar multi-system abnormalities. <solution> {'causal_gene': ['ENSG00000174405']} </solution>",
