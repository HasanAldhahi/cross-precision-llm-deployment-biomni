The gene-disease association is characterized as:\n\n- **Disease**: Miller syndrome\n- **OMIM ID**: 263750\n- **Inheritance Pattern**: Autosomal recessive\n- **Gene Function**: Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, involved in pyrimidine biosynthesis\n\n## Clinical Correlation\nMiller syndrome is characterized by postaxial acrofacial dysostosis, which includes the following classic features [1]:\n\n- Orofacial clefts (matches HP:0000202)\n- Micrognathia (matches HP:0000347)\n- Eyelid colobomas (matches HP:0000625) \n- Cupped ears (matches HP:0000378)\n- Prominent nose (matches HP:0000448)\n- Additional features may include supernumerary nipples and ear abnormalities\n\nThe patient's phenotype constellation shows excellent concordance with the established clinical features of Miller syndrome.\n\n## Final Diagnosis\n**Miller syndrome** (OMIM: 263750)\n\nThis rare genetic disorder is caused by mutations in the DHODH gene and is characterized by the specific combination of facial and craniofacial abnormalities observed in this patient.\n\n---\n\n**References:**\n[1] OMIM database entry for DHODH gene - direct gene-disease association with Miller syndrome (OMIM: 263750)",
