Literature search for sex-differential associations of each gene\n2. GWAS catalog query for multi-trait sex score associations\n3. Functional analysis of candidate genes\n4. Statistical significance assessment across studies\n\n## Key Findings\n\n### Primary Candidate: CETP\n- **Number of studies**: 59 independent studies showing association with multi-trait sex score\n- **Statistical significance**: P-values ranging from 2×10⁻¹⁸⁹ to 1×10⁻⁸\n- **Strongest associations**: Multiple studies showing P-values of 1×10⁻³¹, 1×10⁻⁷⁴, 1×10⁻¹¹⁸, and 1×10⁻¹⁶¹\n- **Biological relevance**: Well-established role in lipid metabolism and HDL cholesterol regulation\n\n### Alternative Candidates\nOther genes from the locus showed limited associations:\n- **BCL11B**: 1 study with P-value 2×10⁻¹¹\n- **BRINP3**: 1 study with P-value 3×10⁻⁸\n- **VSTM2B-DT**: 1 study with P-value 1×10⁻¹²\n- **PHF21A**: 1 study with P-value 1×10⁻⁹\n\n### Biological Rationale\nCETP encodes Cholesteryl Ester Transfer Protein, which:\n- Regulates HDL cholesterol levels\n- Shows documented sex-specific effects in lipid metabolism\n- Has established associations with cardiometabolic traits\n- Demonstrates sexual dimorphism in expression and function\n\n## Evidence Summary\n\nThe multi-trait sex score likely represents a composite measure of sexual dimorphism in cardiometabolic traits. CETP's extensive documentation in sex-specific lipid metabolism, combined with its overwhelming statistical significance (59 studies, P-values reaching 2×10⁻¹⁸⁹), provides compelling evidence for causality.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**CETP** is the most likely causal gene for the Multi-trait sex score phenotype based on:\n1. Superior statistical evidence across multiple independent studies\n2. Strong biological plausibility through its role in lipid metabolism\n3. Documented sex-specific effects in cardiometabolic traits\n4. Consistent associations with HDL cholesterol and related metabolic parameters",
