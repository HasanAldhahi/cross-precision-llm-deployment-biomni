Arthrogryposis, distal, type 5 (OMIM: 108145) - Autosomal dominant\n2. Arthrogryposis, distal, with impaired proprioception and touch (OMIM: 617146) - Autosomal recessive\n3. Arthrogryposis, distal, type 3 (OMIM: 114300) - Autosomal dominant\n4. Marden-Walker syndrome (OMIM: 248700) - Autosomal dominant\n\n## Diagnosis\n\n**Arthrogryposis, distal, type 5**\n- **OMIM ID**: 108145\n- **Inheritance**: Autosomal dominant\n- **Gene**: PIEZO2\n\n## Evidence Summary\n\nThe diagnosis is supported by several key findings:\n\n1. **Phenotype consistency**: The patient's constellation of symptoms including joint contractures (hands and general), scoliosis, cleft palate, short stature, and Chiari malformation aligns with the known clinical manifestations of arthrogryposis conditions.\n\n2. **Genetic evidence**: PIEZO2 mutations are well-established causes of arthrogryposis disorders, particularly distal forms.\n\n3. **Clinical pattern**: The combination of distal arthrogryposis features (joint contractures), major congenital malformations (cleft palate, scoliosis), and systemic involvement (short stature) is characteristic of type 5 distal arthrogryposis.\n\n4. **Database confirmation**: The OMIM database confirms PIEZO2's association with \"Arthrogryposis, distal, type 5, 108145\" with autosomal dominant inheritance.\n\nThis diagnosis represents the most comprehensive match between the patient's phenotypic presentation and the genetic evidence provided by the candidate gene.",
