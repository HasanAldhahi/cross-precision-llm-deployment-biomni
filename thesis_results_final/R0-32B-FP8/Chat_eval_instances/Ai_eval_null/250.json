Let me format this as the requested JSON.</think> **Plan:** 1. [✓] Look up the HP phenotype codes to understand the patient's symptoms 2. [✓] Identify the candidate gene from the Ensembl ID 3. [✓] Search for diseases associated with both the phenotypes and the gene 4. [✓] Find the specific disease name and OMIM ID 5.
