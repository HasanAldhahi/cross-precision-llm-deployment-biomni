This condition is characterized by:\n\n- Congenital joint contractures primarily affecting distal limb parts\n- Contractures of hands and feet\n- Distinctive facial features including prominent nasolabial folds, small mouth, and downslanting palpebral fissures\n- Autosomal dominant inheritance pattern\n\n## Clinical Correlation\nThe patient's complex phenotype profile aligns with the known clinical manifestations of distal arthrogryposis type 2B2. The combination of neurological features (mental retardation, microcephaly), growth abnormalities, and hematological manifestations is consistent with this rare genetic disorder affecting fast skeletal muscle contractile proteins.\n\n## Diagnosis\nBased on the comprehensive analysis of phenotype-gene associations and OMIM database evidence, the patient most likely has **Arthrogryposis, distal, 2B2** caused by mutations in the TNNT3 gene.\n\n```json\n{'disease_name': 'Arthrogryposis, distal, 2B2', 'OMIM_ID': '618435'}\n```",
