Analysis of the HPO database revealed that the candidate gene PIEZO2 is associated with **microstomia** (HP:0000160), which is characterized by a narrow mouth or decreased width of the oral aperture.\n\n## Diagnostic Conclusion\nBased on the systematic analysis of gene-phenotype associations, the most likely diagnosis is **Marden-Walker syndrome** (OMIM: 248700), which is associated with PIEZO2 gene mutations and can present with microstomia as part of its phenotypic spectrum.\n\n**Disease Name:** Marden-Walker syndrome  \n**OMIM ID:** 248700",
