This conclusion is supported by strong therapeutic, mechanistic, and clinical evidence linking CD20 (encoded by MS4A1) to ANCA-associated vasculitis pathogenesis.\n\n## Disease Background\n\nMicroscopic polyangiitis is a rare autoimmune condition characterized by:\n- Small and medium-sized blood vessel inflammation\n- Presence of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA)\n- B-cell mediated autoimmune responses\n- Systemic inflammation affecting multiple organs\n\n## Key Findings\n\n### MS4A1 (CD20) Evidence\n\n**Gene Function**: MS4A1 encodes CD20, a B-cell surface glycoprotein that regulates B-cell activation, proliferation, and differentiation [1].\n\n**Therapeutic Evidence**: \n- Anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (rituximab, obinutuzumab) are established first-line treatments for ANCA-associated vasculitis [2]\n- Clinical trials demonstrate anti-CD20 therapy induces remission in refractory ANCA-associated vasculitis cases [3]\n- CD20+ natural killer cells are enriched in inflammatory disorders [4]\n\n**Mechanistic Evidence**:\n- CD20 deficiency in humans results in impaired T cell-independent antibody responses [5]\n- Anti-CD20 antibody treatment generates T cell regulation of experimental myeloperoxidase ANCA-associated vasculitis [6]\n- The therapeutic mechanism directly relates to B-cell regulation in autoimmune pathogenesis\n\n### Other Genes in Locus\n\nAnalysis of the remaining genes (DARS2, EEF1AK3, MS4A2, MS4A3, MS4A4, MS4A6A, MS4A7, PPIA, TBC1D1) revealed:\n- No direct associations with autoimmune vasculitis\n- Functions primarily related to general cellular processes (protein synthesis, mitochondrial function, metabolic regulation)\n- Limited immune system involvement compared to MS4A1\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**MS4A1** represents the most biologically plausible causal gene for microscopic polyangiitis based on:\n1. Direct therapeutic targeting with anti-CD20 antibodies in ANCA-associated vasculitis\n2. Established role in B-cell function and autoimmune response regulation\n3. Clinical evidence showing efficacy of CD20-directed therapies in treating the exact condition\n4. Absence of comparable evidence for other genes in the locus\n\n## References\n\n[1] MS4A superfamily molecules in tumors, Alzheimer's and autoimmune diseases - Frontiers in Immunology\n[2] Advances in the treatment of ANCA-associated vasculitis - Nature Reviews Rheumatology  \n[3] Reduced-dose obinutuzumab induces remission in refractory ANCA-associated vasculitis - Frontiers in Immunology\n[4] CD20+ natural killer cells are polyfunctional, memory-like cells that are enriched in inflammatory disorders - Journal of Immunology\n[5] CD20 deficiency in humans results in impaired T cell-independent antibody responses - Journal of Clinical Investigation\n[6] Anti-CD20 mAb-Induced B Cell Apoptosis Generates T Cell Regulation of Experimental Myeloperoxidase ANCA-Associated Vasculitis - Journal of the American Society of Nephrology",
