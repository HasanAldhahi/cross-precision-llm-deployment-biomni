GLE1 is a protein-coding gene involved in RNA export and has been associated with several neuromuscular conditions.\n\n### Phenotype Analysis\nThe patient presents with two key developmental phenotypes:\n- **HP:0001263**: Global developmental delay\n- **HP:0001270**: Motor delay\n\n### Disease-Gene Associations\nAnalysis of the Ensembl phenotype database revealed three diseases associated with GLE1 mutations:\n\n1. **Lethal congenital contracture syndrome type 1** (OMIM: 253310)\n2. **Congenital arthrogryposis with anterior horn cell disease** (OMIM: 611890) \n3. **GLE1-related arthrogryposis, lethal, with anterior horn cell disease** (OMIM: 611890)\n\n### Clinical Correlation\nThe patient's phenotypes of global developmental delay and motor delay are consistent with **Congenital arthrogryposis with anterior horn cell disease**, which is characterized by:\n- Congenital contractures (muscle stiffness/contractures)\n- Anterior horn cell disease (neurological involvement)\n- Developmental delays, including motor development\n- Associated with GLE1 gene mutations\n\n## Final Diagnosis\n```json\n{'disease_name': 'Congenital arthrogryposis with anterior horn cell disease', 'OMIM_ID': '611890'}\n```\n\n## Evidence Summary\n- Gene-phenotype associations found in Ensembl database [1]\n- Multiple independent sources confirm GLE1 associations with anterior horn cell disease [2]\n- Clinical phenotypes match established disease characteristics [3]\n\n---\n**References:**\n[1] Ensembl REST API phenotype annotations for GLE1 gene (ENSG00000119392)\n[2] Cross-database validation through ClinVar and Orphanet disease registries\n[3] Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms HP:0001263 and HP:0001270 clinical correlations",
