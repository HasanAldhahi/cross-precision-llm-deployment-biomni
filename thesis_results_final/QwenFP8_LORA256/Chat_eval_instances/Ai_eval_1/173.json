[✓] Decoded the HP phenotype codes to understand the patient's clinical features 2. [✓] Converted Ensembl gene IDs to gene symbols for easier interpretation 3. [✓] Queried databases to find associations between phenotypes and candidate genes 4. [✓] Analyzed the evidence to determine the most likely causal gene 5. [ ] Provide the final answer in the required format The patient's phenotype pattern includes: - Distal muscle weakness (HP:0002460) - Distal sensory impairment (HP:0002936) - Abnormal nerve conduction (HP:0000762) - Amyotrophy/muscular wasting (HP:0003202) - Skin abnormalities (HP:0000951) This combination of features is highly characteristic of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), a hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy. Among the candidate genes, **GDAP1** (ENSG00000104381) is associated with multiple types of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease: - Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, axonal, with vocal cord paresis - Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, recessive intermediate, A - Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, axonal, type 2K - Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, type 4A The neuromuscular phenotype pattern of distal muscle weakness, sensory impairment, and abnormal nerve conduction strongly matches the clinical presentation of CMT disease caused by GDAP1 mutations. <solution> {'causal_gene': ['ENSG00000104381']} </solution>",
