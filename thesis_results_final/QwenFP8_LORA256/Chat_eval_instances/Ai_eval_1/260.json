Patient has joint laxity, joint contractures, and flexion contractures 2. CANT1 gene (ENSG00000154864) is associated with Desbuquois dysplasia 1 (OMIM:251450) 3. Desbuquois dysplasia 1 is characterized by joint laxity, short stature, microcephaly, mental retardation, hypotonia, and developmental delay 4. The patient's phenotypes match Desbuquois dysplasia 1 clinical features Diagnosis: Disease: Desbuquois dysplasia 1 OMIM ID: 251450 Gene: CANT1 (ENSG00000154864) </observation> [22] ASSISTANT: <think> Based on my analysis: 1. The patient has phenotypes: HP:0000508 (Joint laxity), HP:0009473 (Joint contracture of the hand), HP:0001371 (Flexion contracture) 2. The candidate gene ENSG00000154864 corresponds to CANT1 3. From the OMIM dataset, I found that CANT1 is associated with: - Desbuquois dysplasia 1, 251450 (3), Autosomal recessive - Epiphyseal dysplasia, multiple, 7, 617719 (3), Autosomal recessive 4. The patient's phenotypes (joint laxity, joint contractures, flexion contractures) are consistent with Desbuquois dysplasia 1, which is characterized by joint laxity, short stature, microcephaly, mental retardation, hypotonia, and developmental delay. 5. The OMIM ID for Desbuquois dysplasia 1 is 251450. The diagnosis is Desbuquois dysplasia 1 with OMIM ID 251450.</think> <solution> {\"disease_name\": \"Desbuquois dysplasia 1\", \"OMIM_ID\": \"251450\"} </solution>",
