The PubMed search confirms that KCTD1 mutations cause Scalp-Ear-Nipple syndrome The phenotypes match perfectly with the syndrome: - Aplasia cutis congenita (scalp abnormalities) - Absent nipple - Abnormality of the ear This is clearly Scalp-Ear-Nipple syndrome caused by mutations in KCTD1. Let me format the answer as requested.</think> **Plan:** 1. [✓] Look up the HPO (Human Phenotype Ontology) codes to understand the patient's phenotypes 2. [✓] Identify the candidate gene from the Ensembl ID 3. [✓] Query OMIM database to find diseases associated with the gene and phenotypes 4. [✓] Match the phenotypes with the gene to identify the specific rare disease 5. [✓] Format the output as required Based on my analysis: - Patient phenotypes: - HP:0001057: Aplasia cutis congenita - HP:0002561: Absent nipple - HP:0000598: Abnormality of the ear - Candidate gene: ENSG00000134504 (KCTD1 - Potassium channel tetramerization domain-containing 1) - From OMIM database: KCTD1 is associated with \"Scalp-ear-nipple syndrome\" (OMIM ID: 181270) - Literature search confirms that KCTD1 mutations cause Scalp-Ear-Nipple syndrome The patient's phenotypes (scalp abnormalities, absent nipple, ear abnormalities) match perfectly with Scalp-Ear-Nipple syndrome, which is caused by mutations in the KCTD1 gene. <solution> {'disease_name': 'Scalp-ear-nipple syndrome', 'OMIM_ID': '181270'} </solution>",
