The receptor:\n\n- Controls bile acid synthesis and transport\n- Regulates lipid metabolism and fatty acid oxidation\n- Modulates inflammatory pathways in hepatocytes\n- Has been directly implicated in NAFLD pathogenesis through multiple molecular mechanisms\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**NR1H4** is the most likely causal gene for Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease in this locus, supported by:\n- Direct database associations with NAFLD and related liver conditions\n- Robust literature evidence demonstrating functional relevance\n- Well-characterized biological mechanisms linking FXR to liver metabolism\n- Absence of comparable evidence for other genes in the locus\n\nThis gene represents a promising target for further research and potential therapeutic intervention in NAFLD.",
