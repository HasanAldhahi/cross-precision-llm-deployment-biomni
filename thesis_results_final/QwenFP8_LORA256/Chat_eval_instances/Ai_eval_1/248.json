The patient has the phenotype \"Dexamethasone-suppressible primary hyperaldosteronism\" (HP:0011739) 2. The candidate gene is ENSG00000142798, which I found corresponds to CYP11B1 3. From the OMIM data, I found that CYP11B1 is associated with \"Aldosteronism, glucocorticoid-remediable, 103900\" This matches perfectly - dexamethasone-suppressible primary hyperaldosteronism is also known as glucocorticoid-remediable aldosteronism, and it's caused by mutations in the CYP11B1 gene. The OMIM ID is 103900. Let me provide the final answer in the requested format.</think> <solution> {\"disease_name\": \"Aldosteronism, glucocorticoid-remediable\", \"OMIM_ID\": \"103900\"} </solution>",
