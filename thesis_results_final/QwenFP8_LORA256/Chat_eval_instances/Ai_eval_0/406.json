It directly regulates both components of the triglyceride to HDL cholesterol ratio\n2. The LKB1-SIK3 pathway provides a well-established mechanistic framework for metabolic regulation\n3. Multiple independent GWAS studies show highly significant associations with relevant lipid traits\n4. Literature evidence confirms its role in energy balance and lipid homeostasis\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**SIK3** is the most likely causal gene for the triglyceride to HDL cholesterol ratio phenotype within the given locus, supported by robust mechanistic pathways, strong statistical associations, and comprehensive literature evidence.\n\n---\n\n**References:**\n[1] LKB1-SIK3 pathway regulating feeding and fasting signals in lipid metabolism (PMID: 25996931)  \n[2] LKB1 signaling and adipogenesis studies (PMID: 21565616)  \n[3] Transgelin involvement in LDL endocytosis (PMID: 34902367)  \n[4] PCSK7 as apolipoprotein B regulator (PMID: 37967646)  \n[5] SIDT2 and lysosomal lipid metabolism (PMID: 34582051)",
