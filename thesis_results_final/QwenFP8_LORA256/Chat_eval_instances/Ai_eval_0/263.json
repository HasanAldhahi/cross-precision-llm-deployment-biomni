Marden-Walker syndrome is characterized by joint contractures (arthrogryposis), micrognathia, cleft palate, and ophthalmoplegia - which perfectly matches the patient's phenotype combination. The OMIM data shows that PIEZO2 is associated with \"?Marden-Walker syndrome, 248700 (3), Autosomal dominant\" along with other arthrogryposis types. Therefore, the diagnosis should be Marden-Walker syndrome with OMIM ID 248700.</think> **Plan:** 1. [✓] Load the HPO (Human Phenotype Ontology) data to understand the patient's phenotypes 2. [✓] Convert the ENSG ID to a gene symbol (PIEZO2) 3. [✓] Search OMIM database to find diseases associated with the gene and phenotypes 4. [✓] Return the disease name and OMIM ID in the required format 5. [✓] Test the code to ensure it works correctly Based on my analysis: - The candidate gene ENSG00000154864 corresponds to **PIEZO2** - The patient has these phenotypes: **Ophthalmoplegia, Cleft palate, Joint contracture of the hand, Micrognathia** - PIEZO2 is associated with **Marden-Walker syndrome** (OMIM ID 248700) - Marden-Walker syndrome presents with joint contractures (arthrogryposis), micrognathia, cleft palate, and ophthalmoplegia - which perfectly matches the patient's phenotype combination <solution> {\"disease_name\": \"Marden-Walker syndrome\", \"OMIM_ID\": \"248700\"} </solution>",
