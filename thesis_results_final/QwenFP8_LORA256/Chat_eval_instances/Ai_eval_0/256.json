Key evidence: 1. HP:0001249 represents \"Intellectual disability\" 2. ENSG00000101825 represents MXRA5 gene on chromosome X 3. ClinVar found a pathogenic copy number loss variant in the Xp22.33-22.2 region (where MXRA5 is located) associated with intellectual disability 4. Monarch Initiative shows Fanconi anemia is associated with HP:0001249 (intellectual disability) 5. OMIM data shows Fanconi anemia, complementation group B is X-linked recessive with MIM Number: 300515.0 The Xp22.33-22.2 region contains several genes including MXRA5, and Fanconi anemia is a well-established X-linked recessive disease that can cause intellectual disability along with other phenotypes like splenomegaly. The answer should be: - Disease name: Fanconi anemia - OMIM ID: 300515.0 (for the complementation group B form) </think> <solution> { \"disease_name\": \"Fanconi anemia\", \"OMIM_ID\": \"300515.0\" } </solution>",
