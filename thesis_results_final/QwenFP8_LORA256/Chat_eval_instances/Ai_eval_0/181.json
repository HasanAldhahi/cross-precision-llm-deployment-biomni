The patient has a specific phenotype profile consisting of: - HP:0000202: Orofacial cleft - HP:0000347: Micrognathia - HP:0000378: Cupped ear - HP:0000411: Abnormality of the neck - HP:0000448: Prominent nose - HP:0000625: Eyelid coloboma - HP:0002558: Abnormality of the nervous system 2. From the OMIM database, I found that ENSG00000102967 (DHODH) is associated with Miller syndrome (MIM: 263750) 3. Miller syndrome is characterized by: - Orofacial clefts - Micrognathia - Cupped ears - Eyelid colobomas - Neck abnormalities - Prominent nose - Nervous system abnormalities This matches exactly with the patient's phenotype profile. 4. Other candidate genes were found to be associated with different conditions: - Molybdenum cofactor deficiency - Warburg micro syndrome - Ciliary dyskinesia - Intellectual developmental disorders None of these other conditions match the patient's specific phenotype profile. Therefore, the causal gene is DHODH (ENSG00000102967).</think> <solution> {'causal_gene': ['ENSG00000102967']} </solution>",
