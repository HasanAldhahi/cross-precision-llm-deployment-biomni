[✓] Load and understand the HPO terms to identify the patient's phenotypes (completed) 2. [✓] Convert the candidate gene IDs to gene symbols using appropriate databases (completed) 3. [✓] Query ClinVar and OMIM databases to find associations between genes and phenotypes (completed) 4. [✓] Analyze the phenotype-gene associations to identify the most likely causal gene (completed) 5. [ ] Output the result in the required format Based on my comprehensive analysis of the patient's phenotypes and candidate genes from OMIM, I identified that SLC35A3 (ENSG00000117620) shows the most comprehensive match to the patient's complex phenotype pattern. The patient presents with a complex phenotype involving intellectual disability, cerebellar atrophy, myoclonus, hypoglycemia, food intolerance, arthropathy, ventriculomegaly, and other neurological and metabolic features. SLC35A3 is associated with \"Arthrogryposis, impaired intellectual development, and seizures\" which comprehensively matches the patient's key neurological and structural abnormalities. <solution> {'causal_gene': ['ENSG00000117620']} </solution>",
