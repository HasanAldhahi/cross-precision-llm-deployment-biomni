CCR4 corresponds to ENSG00000006283 in the Ensembl database.</think> Based on my systematic analysis of the literature connections and gene-phenotype associations, I can now provide the final answer. **Updated Plan:** 1. [✓] Check available data in the biological data lake 2. [✓] Convert Ensembl gene IDs to gene symbols using OMIM data 3. [✓] Look up the meaning of HP phenotype terms 4. [✓] Find associations between candidate genes and phenotypes in OMIM data 5. [✓] Analyze literature connections for T-cell lymphoma relevance 6. [✓] Provide the final answer in the required format From the literature analysis, I found that **CCR4** (ENSG00000006283) has the strongest and most direct connection to T-cell lymphoma, with multiple papers specifically addressing: - Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma - HTLV-1 infection leading to T-cell lymphoma - Clonal expansion and transformation of HTLV-1-infected T cells - Prognostic factors in T-cell lymphoma patients While other genes like CMTM6, CMTM7, and CRTAP show some immune/cancer-related associations, CCR4 demonstrates the most specific and direct literature evidence linking it to T-cell lymphoma. <solution> {'causal_gene': ['ENSG00000006283']} </solution>",
