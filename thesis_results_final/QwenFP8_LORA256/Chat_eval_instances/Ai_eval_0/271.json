The phenotype combination is highly characteristic of Marden-Walker syndrome Final diagnosis: Marden-Walker syndrome, OMIM ID: 248700 </observation> [84] ASSISTANT: <think> I have now found the information I need. Let me analyze what I've discovered: 1. The candidate gene ENSG00000154864 corresponds to PIEZO2 2. The patient has the following phenotypes: - HP:0000602: Ophthalmoplegia - HP:0000175: Cleft palate - HP:0004322: Short stature - HP:0002650: Scoliosis - HP:0000508: Ptosis - HP:0009473: Joint contracture of the hand 3. From the OMIM database, I found that PIEZO2 is associated with several diseases, including \"Marden-Walker syndrome, 248700\" in the phenotypes field 4. The combination of ophthalmoplegia, cleft palate, short stature, scoliosis, ptosis, and joint contractures is very characteristic of Marden-Walker syndrome, which is a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in PIEZO2 The OMIM ID for Marden-Walker syndrome appears to be 248700 based on the data I found in the OMIM database. Let me provide the final answer in the requested format.</think> <solution> { \"disease_name\": \"Marden-Walker syndrome\", \"OMIM_ID\": \"248700\" } </solution>",
