[✓] Checking GWAS catalog for prostate cancer associations (completed) 3. [✓] Examine gene-disease associations from DisGeNET database (completed) 4. [✓] Analyze biological functions and pathways of the most promising candidates (completed) 5. [✓] Identify the most likely causal gene based on evidence (completed) Based on my comprehensive analysis of the literature, GWAS catalog, and gene-disease associations, I have found strong evidence that APEX1 is the most likely causal gene for Prostatic Neoplasms from the given locus. APEX1 (Apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1) is a DNA repair enzyme that processes apurinic/apyrimidinic sites in DNA, and it has been extensively studied in prostate cancer research with multiple meta-analyses confirming its association with prostate cancer risk and prognosis. The other genes in the locus showed no comparable evidence for direct involvement in prostate cancer. <solution> {APEX1} </solution>",
