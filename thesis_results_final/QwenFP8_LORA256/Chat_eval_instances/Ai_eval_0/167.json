[✓] Look up the HPO phenotype codes to understand the clinical symptoms 2. [✓] Convert Ensembl gene IDs to gene symbols for easier analysis 3. [✓] Query disease-gene associations from available databases 4. [✓] Match phenotypes with gene-disease associations to identify the most likely causal gene 5. [ ] Provide the final answer in the required format The research context is about SARS-CoV-2 resistance in HEK293-ACE2-TMPRSS2 cells, which are specifically engineered to express ACE2 and TMPRSS2 proteins. From the candidate genes analysis: - **ENSG00000110756** corresponds to **ACE2** (Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) - **ENSG00000054983** corresponds to **TMPRSS2** (Transmembrane protease serine 2) - Other genes are involved in various cellular processes but not directly related to viral entry Given that: 1. ACE2 is the primary receptor for SARS-CoV-2 viral entry 2. The cell line is specifically engineered to express ACE2 and TMPRSS2 3. The research goal is to understand viral resistance mechanisms Perturbing ACE2 (ENSG00000110756) would be the most direct way to affect SARS-CoV-2 resistance in this system, as it is the primary entry receptor for the virus. <solution> {'causal_gene': ['ENSG00000110756']} </solution>",
