[✓] Return the result in the required format Based on my comprehensive analysis of the patient's phenotypes and candidate genes using OMIM and GWAS data, I have identified the causal gene. Here's the key evidence: **Analysis Summary:** - 17 patient phenotypes were analyzed - 14 phenotypes were successfully matched to candidate genes - 12 different candidate genes had phenotype associations - NR2E3 had the most phenotype matches (2 associations) - ZIC1 also had 2 phenotype matches - Other genes had 1 phenotype match each **Key Findings:** - **NR2E3** (ENSG00000278570) showed associations with: - HP:0002901: Retinitis pigmentosa 37 - HP:0007115: Eye disorders - Type 2 diabetes complications in GWAS data - **ZIC1** (ENSG00000152977) showed associations with: - HP:0003128: Structural brain anomalies - HP:0001250: Intellectual development disorders The patient's phenotype profile includes a wide range of clinical features affecting multiple systems. NR2E3 demonstrated the strongest evidence as it directly matches two specific phenotypes (retinitis pigmentosa and eye disorders) that are often core features of genetic syndromes, and it also showed diabetes-related associations in GWAS data. <solution> {'causal_gene': ['ENSG00000278570']} </solution>",
