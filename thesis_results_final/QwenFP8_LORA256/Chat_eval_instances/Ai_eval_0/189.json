Direct documentation of antiviral mechanisms in peer-reviewed literature\n2. Specific role in preventing viral degradation and supporting immune response\n3. Clear alignment with the patient's viral resistance phenotype\n4. Well-established biological pathways connecting FLCN to viral defense\n\nThe evidence strongly supports FLCN as the gene most likely responsible for the observed viral resistance phenotype in this patient.\n\n**Answer: {'causal_gene': ['ENSG00000136643']}**",
