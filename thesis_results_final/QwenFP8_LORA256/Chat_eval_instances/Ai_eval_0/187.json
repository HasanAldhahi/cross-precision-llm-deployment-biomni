[ ] Provide the final answer in the required format Based on my comprehensive analysis, I have identified the most likely causal gene. The patient's phenotype profile includes: **Key phenotypes:** - HP:0000347: Abnormality of the head or neck - HP:0000369: Abnormality of the eye - HP:0002463: Abnormality of the brain - HP:0003552: Abnormality of the muscle - HP:0030015: Abnormality of the intellectual development - HP:0030854: Abnormality of the speech - Plus additional abnormalities in other organ systems **Gene analysis:** - **POMT2 (ENSG00000009830)**: Shows 5/7 key phenotype matches with OMIM-listed phenotypes including \"muscular dystrophy-dystroglycanopathy (congenital with brain and eye anomalies)\" and \"muscular dystrophy-dystroglycanopathy (congenital with impaired intellectual development)\" - **NALCN (ENSG00000102452)**: Shows 2/7 key phenotype matches with \"congenital contractures of the limbs and face, hypotonia, and developmental delay\" - **SLC35A3 (ENSG00000117620)**: Shows 1/7 key phenotype match with \"intellectual disability\" POMT2 demonstrates the best match to the patient's complex phenotype profile, which is consistent with Walker-Warburg syndrome and other forms of muscular dystrophy-dystroglycanopathy. These conditions are characterized by congenital muscular dystrophy, brain malformations, eye abnormalities, intellectual disability, and multi-system involvement. <solution> {'causal_gene': ['ENSG00000009830']} </solution>",
