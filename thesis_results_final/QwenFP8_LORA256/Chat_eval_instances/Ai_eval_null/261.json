Gene Identification\nThe candidate gene ENSG00000154864 was identified in the OMIM database as **PIEZO2** (PIEZO-type mechanosensitive ion channel component 2).\n\n### 2. Disease Associations for PIEZO2\nPIEZO2 is associated with the following diseases in OMIM:\n- Arthrogryposis, distal, type 5 (OMIM: 108145)\n- Arthrogryposis, distal, with impaired proprioception and touch (OMIM: 617146)\n- Arthrogryposis, distal, type 3 (OMIM: 114300)\n- Marden-Walker syndrome (OMIM: 248700)\n\n### 3. Phenotype Analysis\nThe patient's phenotypes include:\n- HP:0000508 (Ptosis - drooping of the upper eyelid)\n- HP:0000602 (Ptosis)\n- HP:0004322 (Ptosis)\n- HP:0009473 (Ptosis)\n\n### 4. Disease-Phenotype Matching\nAmong the PIEZO2-associated diseases, **Marden-Walker syndrome** is characterized by ptosis as a key phenotype. This syndrome includes:\n- Ptosis (drooping eyelids)\n- Joint contractures\n- Intellectual disability\n- Facial dysmorphism\n\n### 5. Diagnosis Confirmation\nBased on the phenotype analysis showing ptosis across multiple HP codes and the PIEZO2 gene associations, **Marden-Walker syndrome** is the most likely diagnosis given the patient presents the hallmark phenotype of ptosis.\n\n---\n\n## Diagnosis Result\n```json\n{'disease_name': 'Marden-Walker syndrome', 'OMIM_ID': '248700'}\n```",
