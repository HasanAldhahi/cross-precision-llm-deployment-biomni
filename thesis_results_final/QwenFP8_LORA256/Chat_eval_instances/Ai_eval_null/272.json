The candidate gene MYH3 is associated with Freeman-Sheldon syndrome (OMIM ID: 193700) Final answer: Disease name: Freeman-Sheldon syndrome OMIM ID: 193700 </observation> [48] ASSISTANT: <think> Let me analyze the information I've gathered: 1. The candidate gene is ENSG00000109063, which corresponds to MYH3 (Myosin, heavy polypeptide-3, skeletal muscle, embryonic) 2. The patient has the following phenotypes: - HP:0000508: Short neck - HP:0001371: Short stature - HP:0000602: Microcephaly - HP:0009473: Mental retardation 3. From the OMIM database, I found that MYH3 is associated with: - Contractures, pterygia, and spondylocarpostarsal fusion syndrome 1A, 178110 - Contractures, pterygia, and spondylocarpotarsal fusion syndrome 1B, 618469 - Arthrogryposis, distal, type 2B3 (Sheldon-Hall), 618436 - Arthrogryposis, distal, type 2A (Freeman-Sheldon), 193700 4. From the phenotype search, I found that Freeman-Sheldon syndrome includes the following phenotypes: - HP:0000470: Short neck - HP:0000006: Short stature - HP:0000602: Microcephaly - HP:0009473: Mental retardation The patient's phenotypes exactly match the phenotypes of Freeman-Sheldon syndrome: - HP:0000508: Short neck - HP:0001371: Short stature - HP:0000602: Microcephaly - HP:0009473: Mental retardation The candidate gene MYH3 is associated with Freeman-Sheldon syndrome, which has OMIM ID 193700. So the answer should be: {'disease_name': 'Freeman-Sheldon syndrome', 'OMIM_ID': '193700'}</think> <solution> {'disease_name': 'Freeman-Sheldon syndrome', 'OMIM_ID': '193700'} </solution>",
