Let me summarize what I found: 1. The candidate gene ENSG00000154864 corresponds to PIEZO2 (PIEZO-type mechanosensitive ion channel component 2) 2. The patient has the following phenotypes: - HP:0000508: Ptosis - HP:0001371: Flexion contracture - HP:0000602: Ophthalmoplegia - HP:0009473: Joint contracture of the hand - HP:0002650: Scoliosis 3. From the OMIM data, I found that PIEZO2 is associated with several diseases: - Arthrogryposis, distal, type 5 (OMIM: 108145) - Arthrogryposis, distal, with impaired proprioception and touch (OMIM: 617146) - Arthrogryposis, distal, type 3 (OMIM: 114300) - Marden-Walker syndrome (OMIM: 248700) 4. The combination of ptosis, ophthalmoplegia, joint contractures of the hand, flexion contractures, and scoliosis is characteristic of Marden-Walker syndrome, which is also known as distal arthrogryposis type 5. The diagnosis is Marden-Walker syndrome with OMIM ID 248700.</think> <solution> {\"disease_name\": \"Marden-Walker syndrome\", \"OMIM_ID\": 248700} </solution>",
