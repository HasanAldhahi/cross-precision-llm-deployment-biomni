OMIM database analysis revealed that PIEZO2 is associated with multiple arthrogryposis conditions, including:\n- Arthrogryposis, distal, type 5 (OMIM: 108145)\n- Arthrogryposis, distal, with impaired proprioception and touch (OMIM: 617146)\n- Arthrogryposis, distal, type 3 (OMIM: 114300)\n- **Marden-Walker syndrome (OMIM: 248700)**\n\n## Phenotype Analysis\nThe patient presents with the following clinical features:\n\n| HPO ID | Phenotype Description |\n|--------|-----------------------|\n| HP:0009473 | A tongue-like protusion from the anterior aspect of lumbar vertebral bodies |\n| HP:0001371 | A flexion contracture is a bent (flexed) joint that cannot be straightened actively or passively |\n| HP:0000602 | An abnormality of refraction characterized by the ability to see objects nearby clearly, while objects in the distance appear blurry |\n| HP:0002650 | The presence of an abnormal lateral curvature of the spine |\n| HP:0001488 | Drooping of both upper eyelids |\n\n## Disease Matching\nThe combination of these phenotypes is highly characteristic of **Marden-Walker syndrome**, a rare form of arthrogryposis with the following key features:\n- **Congenital joint contractures** (HP:0001371) - hallmark feature\n- **Scoliosis** (HP:0002650) - commonly seen\n- **Vertebral abnormalities** (HP:0009473) - can occur\n- **Ptosis/eyelid drooping** (HP:0001488) - characteristic feature\n- **Ophthalmoplegia/refractive abnormalities** (HP:0000602) - can be present\n\n## Diagnostic Conclusion\n**Marden-Walker syndrome** (OMIM: 248700) is the most likely diagnosis based on:\n1. **Genetic evidence:** PIEZO2 mutations are associated with Marden-Walker syndrome\n2. **Phenotypic evidence:** The patient's clinical features match the syndrome's characteristic presentation\n3. **Disease association:** OMIM database confirms PIEZO2-disease connection\n\nThe diagnosis is supported by the congruence between the genetic candidate gene and the patient's phenotypic profile, which together strongly indicate Marden-Walker syndrome.\n\n## Output\n```json\n{\n  \"disease_name\": \"Marden-Walker syndrome\",\n  \"OMIM_ID\": \"248700\"\n}\n```",
