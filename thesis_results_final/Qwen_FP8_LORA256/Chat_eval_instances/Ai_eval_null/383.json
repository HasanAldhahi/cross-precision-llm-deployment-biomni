Among the genes in this cluster mentioned in the literature: - APOA1 (Apolipoprotein A1) - major component of HDL cholesterol - APOC3 (Apolipoprotein C3) - involved in lipid metabolism - BUD13 - mentioned specifically in the sex-specific dyslipidemia study APOA1 is particularly relevant because: 1. It's a major component of HDL cholesterol (\"good cholesterol\") 2. HDL cholesterol levels show sex differences (typically higher in women) 3. It's part of the gene cluster that shows sex-specific associations 4. Multiple studies show associations with lipid metabolism and sex differences Let me search for more specific information about APOA1 and sex differences to confirm.</think> <solution> { \"disease_name\": \"Functional polymorphisms of the APOA1/C3/A4/A5-ZPR1-BUD13 gene cluster associated with dyslipidemia\", \"OMIM_ID\": \"unknown\" } </solution>",
