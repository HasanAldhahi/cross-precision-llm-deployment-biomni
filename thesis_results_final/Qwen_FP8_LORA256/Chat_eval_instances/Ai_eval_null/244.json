The candidate gene ENSG00000141556 corresponds to TBCD (tubulin folding cofactor D) 2. The patient's phenotypes are: - HP:0001250: Seizure - HP:0002169: Clonus - HP:0002312: Clumsiness - HP:0002069: Bilateral tonic-clonic seizure 3. From the OMIM data, TBCD is associated with \"Encephalopathy, progressive, early-onset, with brain atrophy and thin corpus callosum\" with OMIM ID 617193 The phenotypes (seizures, clonus, clumsiness) are consistent with progressive encephalopathy. I've found the disease associated with the TBCD gene in OMIM. Let me provide the final answer in the required format.</think> **Plan:** 1. [✓] Convert the ENSG ID to a gene symbol (completed - TBCD) 2. [✓] Convert the HP codes to their human-readable phenotype names (completed - Seizure, Clonus, Clumsiness, Bilateral tonic-clonic seizure) 3. [✓] Query disease databases to find diseases that match both the phenotypes and the gene (completed - Found association in OMIM) 4. [✓] Return the disease name and OMIM ID in the required format (ready) <solution> {'disease_name': 'Encephalopathy, progressive, early-onset, with brain atrophy and thin corpus callosum', 'OMIM_ID': '617193'} </solution>",
