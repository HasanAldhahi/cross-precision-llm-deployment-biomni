The key phenotypes I found in the OMIM data for Miller syndrome match several of the patient's phenotypes. Let me update my plan and provide the solution.</think> **Plan Update:** 1. [✓] Convert HPO terms to human-readable phenotype descriptions (completed) 2. [✓] Identify the gene corresponding to ENSG00000102967 using Ensembl API (completed - DHODH) 3. [✓] Query OMIM database for diseases associated with this gene (completed - Miller syndrome, 263750) 4. [✓] Match the phenotypes with the diseases to find the most likely diagnosis (completed) 5. [ ] Format the output as requested Based on my analysis: **Gene Identification:** ENSG00000102967 corresponds to DHODH (dihydroorotate dehydrogenase) **Disease Association:** DHODH mutations are associated with Miller syndrome (OMIM ID: 263750) **Patient Phenotypes:** The patient has the following phenotypes: - Micrognathia (small jaw) - Protruding ear - Cupped ear - Supernumerary nipple - Eyelid coloboma - Orofacial cleft - Prominent nose **Diagnosis:** Miller syndrome is characterized by post-axial acrofacial dysostosis and is associated with DHODH mutations. The patient's phenotypes (micrognathia, ear abnormalities, eyelid coloboma, orofacial cleft, prominent nose) are consistent with Miller syndrome. <solution> {'disease_name': 'Miller syndrome', 'OMIM_ID': '263750'} </solution>",
