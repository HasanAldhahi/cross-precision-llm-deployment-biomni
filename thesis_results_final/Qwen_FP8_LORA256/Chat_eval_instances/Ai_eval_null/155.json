ESR1 is central to estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer biology The other genes (AKAP12, ARMT1, CCDC170, RMND1, SYNE1, ZBTB2) showed no clear breast cancer associations in my searches. ESR1 is the estrogen receptor gene, which is one of the most important genes in breast cancer biology and is routinely tested as part of breast cancer diagnostics. The literature clearly supports ESR1 as the causal gene for breast cancer susceptibility in this list. Let me provide the final answer in the required format.</think> <solution> Based on comprehensive literature analysis, ESR1 (Estrogen Receptor 1) emerges as the clear causal gene for breast cancer susceptibility among the candidates. The evidence demonstrates: 1. **Strong Literature Support**: Multiple studies directly link ESR1 to breast cancer susceptibility, progression, and treatment response 2. **Clinical Relevance**: ESR1 mutations are detected in metastatic breast cancer and impact therapeutic outcomes 3. **Mechanistic Role**: ESR1 encodes the estrogen receptor, a fundamental driver of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer 4. **GWAS Evidence**: Genetic variants in ESR1 show associations with breast cancer risk in population studies The other candidate genes (AKAP12, ARMT1, CCDC170, RMND1, SYNE1, ZBTB2) showed no significant breast cancer associations in the literature searches. <solution> {'causal_gene': ['ESR1']} </solution>",
