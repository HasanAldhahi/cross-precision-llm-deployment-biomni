Disease information: Scalp-ear-nipple syndrome, 181270 (3), Autosomal dominant Final diagnosis: Disease Name: Scalp-ear-nipple syndrome OMIM ID: 181270 Candidate Gene: KCTD1 Patient Phenotypes: ['HP:0002561', 'HP:0001057', 'HP:0000598'] Verification: Patient phenotypes include: absent nipple, aplasia cutis congenita, ear abnormality Scalp-ear-nipple syndrome typically involves: scalp defects, ear abnormalities, nipple abnormalities Match: ✗ </observation> [36] ASSISTANT: <think> Let me check the verification step. The patient phenotypes are: - HP:0002561: Absent nipple - HP:0001057: Aplasia cutis congenita - HP:0000598: Abnormality of the ear The disease \"Scalp-ear-nipple syndrome\" typically involves: - Scalp defects - Ear abnormalities - Nipple abnormalities The patient has: - Absent nipple (nipple abnormality) - ✓ - Aplasia cutis congenita (scalp defect) - ✓ - Abnormality of the ear (ear abnormality) - ✓ So the match should be correct. The verification message shows a checkmark but the logic was flawed. Let me provide the final answer.</think> <solution> {'disease_name': 'Scalp-ear-nipple syndrome', 'OMIM_ID': '181270'} </solution>",
