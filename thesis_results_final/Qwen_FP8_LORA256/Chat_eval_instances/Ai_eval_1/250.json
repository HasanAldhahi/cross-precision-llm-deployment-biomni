The phenotypes I found match what would be expected for Nager syndrome: - Absent lower eyelashes - Micrognathia (small jaw) - Cleft palate - Hearing impairment - Abnormal thumb morphology This seems to be a clear match. Let me update my plan and provide the final answer.</think> **Plan:** 1. [✓] Look up the candidate gene ENSG00000143368 to identify what gene it is (SF3B4) 2. [✓] Look up the HP phenotype terms to understand what clinical features they represent 3. [✓] Query databases to find diseases associated with this gene and these phenotypes 4. [✓] Identify the specific disease that matches both the gene and phenotypes (Nager syndrome) 5. [✓] Output the disease name and OMIM ID in the required format Based on my analysis: - The candidate gene ENSG00000143368 corresponds to SF3B4 (Splicing factor 3B, subunit 4) - From the OMIM database, SF3B4 is associated with \"Acrofacial dysostosis 1, Nager type\" with OMIM ID 154400 - The patient's phenotypes (absent lower eyelashes, micrognathia, cleft palate, hearing impairment, abnormal thumb morphology) are consistent with Nager syndrome <solution> {'disease_name': 'Acrofacial dysostosis 1, Nager type', 'OMIM_ID': '154400'} </solution>",
