Gene Function Analysis\n- **NAT8 (N-Acetyltransferase 8)**: Encodes ATase2, an N-acetyltransferase enzyme that catalyzes the acetylation of various substrates, including amino acids (1)\n- **NAT8B (N-Acetyltransferase 8B)**: Encodes ATase1, a closely related N-acetyltransferase (2)\n- Both enzymes are directly involved in **N-acetylation processes** and cellular metabolism\n\n### 2. Direct Metabolite Association\n- A key study specifically demonstrates: \"NAT8 Variants, N-Acetylated Amino Acids, and Progression of CKD\" (3)\n- This study shows that NAT8 genetic variants affect **N-acetylated amino acid levels** in circulation\n- N-acetylasparagine is an **N-acetylated amino acid** that would be directly metabolized by NAT8\n\n### 3. Biological Pathway Connection\n- N-acetylasparagine is formed through the acetylation of asparagine\n- NAT8 enzymes catalyze N-acetylation reactions, making them the **direct metabolic pathway** for N-acetylasparagine production\n- Other genes in the locus (ACTG2, ALMS1, etc.) show no clear functional connection to N-acetylasparagine metabolism\n\n### 4. GWAS Evidence\n- While no direct GWAS studies were found for N-acetylasparagine specifically, multiple studies show:\n  - NAT8 associations with metabolite concentrations in urine (4)\n  - NAT8 involvement in cellular acetyl-CoA metabolism (5)\n  - Secretome disruption by NAT8 overexpression affecting metabolite profiles (6)\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**NAT8** is the most likely causal gene because:\n- It encodes an N-acetyltransferase enzyme directly responsible for N-acetylation reactions\n- It has documented associations with N-acetylated amino acid levels in circulation\n- The biological function matches the metabolic phenotype exactly\n- Other genes in the locus lack this direct functional connection\n\n---\n\n**References:**\n(1) Molecular identification of NAT8 as the enzyme that acetylates cysteine S-conjugates to mercapturic acids  \n(2) Increased expression of ATase1/NAT8B or ATase2/NAT8 in the mouse results in altered metabolite profiles  \n(3) NAT8 Variants, N-Acetylated Amino Acids, and Progression of CKD study demonstrating direct metabolite associations  \n(4) Untargeted Metabolome- and Transcriptome-Wide Association Study Suggests Causal Genes Modulating Metabolite Concentrations in Urine  \n(5) Endoplasmic reticulum acetyltransferases Atase1 and Atase2 regulate cellular acetyl-CoA metabolism  \n(6) Overexpression of ATase1 and ATase2 disrupts the secretome and causes progeria phenotype",
