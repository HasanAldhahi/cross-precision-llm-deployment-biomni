CETP demonstrates the strongest statistical evidence with p-values as low as 4×10⁻¹⁸⁹ and 59 total associations with the phenotype.\n\n## Methodology\n\n1. **GWAS Catalog Search**: Queried the GWAS Catalog API and local dataset for \"Multi-trait sex score\" associations\n2. **Locus Analysis**: Systematically evaluated all 28 genes in the specified locus for associations with the phenotype\n3. **Statistical Assessment**: Compared p-values and association counts across all candidate genes\n4. **Biological Validation**: Examined the functional relevance of top candidates to sex-related traits\n\n## Key Findings\n\n### Statistical Evidence\n- **CETP**: 59 associations with p-values ranging from 4×10⁻¹⁸⁹ to 6×10⁻⁸\n- **HERPUD1**: 27 associations with p-values down to 4×10⁻¹⁸⁹\n- **NUP93**: 13 associations with p-values down to 3×10⁻²³\n- **SLC12A3**: 20 associations with p-values down to 2×10⁻²⁷\n- **NLRC5**: 19 associations with p-values down to 6×10⁻²²\n\n### Biological Relevance\nCETP (Cholesteryl Ester Transfer Protein) is directly involved in:\n- Transfer of neutral lipids between lipoprotein particles\n- Regulation of HDL cholesterol levels\n- Reverse cholesterol transport\n- Sex-specific effects in lipid metabolism\n\n### Sex Difference Mechanism\nThe biological plausibility for CETP stems from:\n1. **HDL Cholesterol Regulation**: HDL levels show well-established sex differences\n2. **Lipid Metabolism**: Lipid profiles differ significantly between sexes\n3. **Clinical Evidence**: CETP inhibitors demonstrate sex-specific effects in trials\n4. **Polymorphism Effects**: CETP variants affect lipid profiles differently in males vs females\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**CETP is the most likely causal gene** for the multi-trait sex score phenotype based on:\n- Strongest statistical associations (lowest p-values, highest association count)\n- Clear biological mechanism through sex differences in lipid metabolism\n- Established literature supporting sex-specific effects of CETP variants\n- Direct relevance to HDL cholesterol regulation, a key component of sex-related metabolic traits\n\nThe multi-trait sex score phenotype likely captures composite metabolic traits that differ between sexes, with CETP serving as a central regulator of these sex-specific differences in lipid metabolism.\n\n---\n\n**Answer: CETP**",
