[✓] Look up the HPO phenotypes (HP:0001263, HP:0001270) - Identified as Global developmental delay and Motor delay 3. [✓] Search OMIM database for diseases associated with GLE1 gene - Found two diseases: Lethal congenital contracture syndrome 1 (OMIM:253310) and Congenital arthrogryposis with anterior horn cell disease (OMIM:611890) 4. [✓] Check which disease matches both phenotypes - Found that \"lethal arthrogryposis-anterior horn cell disease syndrome\" includes both motor delay (HP:0001270) and generalized hypotonia/developmental delay phenotypes 5. [✓] Format the output as required The patient presents with: - HP:0001263: Global developmental delay - HP:0001270: Motor delay The candidate gene ENSG00000119392 corresponds to GLE1. From the OMIM database, GLE1 is associated with two diseases: 1. Lethal congenital contracture syndrome 1 (OMIM:253310) - primarily characterized by joint contractures 2. Congenital arthrogryposis with anterior horn cell disease (OMIM:611890) - characterized by motor neuron involvement and includes both motor delay and generalized hypotonia/developmental delay phenotypes The disease that best matches both phenotypes HP:0001263 and HP:0001270 is \"lethal arthrogryposis-anterior horn cell disease syndrome\" (MONDO:0012750), which has the OMIM ID 611890. <solution> {'disease_name': 'Lethal arthrogryposis-anterior horn cell disease syndrome', 'OMIM_ID': '611890'} </solution>",
