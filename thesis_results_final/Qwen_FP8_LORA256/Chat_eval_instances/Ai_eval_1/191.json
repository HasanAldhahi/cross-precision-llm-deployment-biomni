[✓] Provide the final answer in the required format The patient presents with a constellation of phenotypes including: - Tetralogy of Fallot (HP:0001636) - a congenital heart defect - Dolichocephaly (HP:0000268) - long head shape - Broad forehead (HP:0000337) - facial dysmorphism - Brachydactyly (HP:0001156) - short fingers/toes - Intrauterine growth retardation (HP:0001511) - growth abnormalities - Nephrocalcinosis (HP:0000121) - kidney calcium deposits - And other systemic features From the OMIM database analysis, I found that **JAG1 (ENSG00000101384)** is directly associated with: - Tetralogy of Fallot (187500) - Alagille syndrome 1 (118450) - Congenital heart defects and facial dysmorphisms The patient's phenotype pattern is highly characteristic of Alagille syndrome, which is caused by JAG1 mutations. This syndrome includes: - Congenital heart defects (Tetralogy of Fallot) - Facial dysmorphisms (dolichocephaly, broad forehead, abnormal supraorbital ridges) - Skeletal abnormalities (brachydactyly) - Growth retardation - Liver/renal abnormalities No other candidate genes showed direct associations with the patient's key phenotypes, particularly the specific combination of heart defects and facial dysmorphisms. <solution> {'causal_gene': ['ENSG00000101384']} </solution>",
