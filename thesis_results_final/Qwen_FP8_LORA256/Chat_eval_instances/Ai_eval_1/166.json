[✓] Output the causal gene in the required format Based on my comprehensive analysis of the patient's phenotypes and candidate genes: **Key findings:** - CANT1 (ENSG00000171302) showed the highest number of phenotype matches (11 unique matches) - CANT1 is associated with Desbuquois dysplasia and multiple epiphyseal dysplasia in OMIM - These skeletal dysplasias explain the patient's complex phenotype pattern including: - Short neck - Bell-shaped thorax - Ventricular septal defect - Depressed nasal bridge - Accelerated skeletal maturation - Aplasia/Hypoplasia of abdominal wall musculature - Small hand - Joint dislocations - Ataxia - Intellectual disability - Glaucoma The other candidate genes had significantly fewer phenotype matches: - CPOX: 7 matches - ZDHHC15: 2 matches - FYN: 2 matches - DYSF, COL4A3, TLR5, APOA5: 1 match each - RAB28, CD3D, TACC2, CASP6: 0 matches CANT1 provides the most comprehensive explanation for the patient's multiple skeletal, developmental, and systemic abnormalities. <solution> {'causal_gene': ['ENSG00000171302']} </solution>",
