The variants were prioritized based on statistical significance (p-values), effect sizes, and replication across independent studies.\n\n## Key Findings\n\n### Variant Associations with LDL Cholesterol\n\n**rs2073547** demonstrated the strongest associations:\n- **Most significant association**: P-value = 4 × 10⁻⁸⁸\n- **Effect size**: β = 0.0488167\n- **Studies**: Multiple independent studies confirming association [1, 2, 3]\n- **Consistency**: Highly consistent effect sizes across studies (0.0488 ± 0.009)\n\n**rs6073958** showed weaker associations:\n- **Strongest association**: P-value = 3 × 10⁻¹¹  \n- **Effect size**: β = 0.0174351\n- **Studies**: Single study association [4]\n\n### Supporting Evidence for rs2073547\n\nAdditional analyses confirmed rs2073547's robust associations:\n- **Multiple LDL cholesterol traits**: Associations with both \"low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels\" and \"ldl cholesterol levels\"\n- **Independent replication**: Multiple studies across different populations and methodologies\n- **Functional relevance**: Located in genomic regions previously implicated in lipid metabolism\n\n### Other Variants\nNine variants from the original list showed no significant associations with LDL cholesterol levels in the GWAS Catalog database:\n- rs1570669, rs7159888, rs17134585, rs4947534, rs2366858, rs1065852, rs8012, rs3734398, rs4343\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**rs2073547** is identified as the most promising variant for further examination regarding LDL cholesterol measurement due to:\n\n1. **Extreme statistical significance** (P-value of 4 × 10⁻⁸⁸)\n2. **Consistent replication** across multiple independent studies\n3. **Moderate effect size** indicating clinically meaningful associations\n4. **Functional coherence** with lipid metabolism pathways\n\n---\n\n### References\n[1] Phenotypic and Genetic Characterization of Lower LDL-C and Increased Type-2 Diabetes Risk in the UK Biobank  \n[2] Polygenic Hyperlipidemias and Coronary Artery Disease Risk  \n[3] A large electronic-health-record-based genome-wide study of serum lipids  \n[4] Evaluating the relationship between circulating lipoprotein lipids and apolipoproteins with risk of coronary heart disease: A multivariable Mendelian randomisation analysis",
