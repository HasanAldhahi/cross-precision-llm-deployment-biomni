The association details are: - Variant: rs603424 - Trait: metabolite levels (myristoleate (14:1n5); myristoleic acid) - P-value: 1.9999999999999998e-30 (extremely significant) - Effect size (Beta): 0.203 While rs12916 has many associations with various traits, none of them specifically mention myristic acid or myristoleic acid. The other variants either have no associations or associations with different traits. Since rs603424 is the only variant with a direct association to myristoleic acid (which is essentially the same as myristic acid in terms of GWAS traits), and it has an extremely significant p-value of ~2e-30, this should be the most promising variant for further examination. Let me provide the final answer in the required JSON format.</think> <solution> {\"variant\": \"rs603424\"} </solution>",
