Key steps included:\n\n1. Querying for uridine-specific studies and traits\n2. Examining each variant's association with uridine and related metabolites\n3. Evaluating statistical significance (p-values) and biological relevance\n4. Cross-referencing variant-trait associations across multiple studies\n\n## Key Findings\n\n### Direct Uridine Associations\n- **rs532545**: Direct association with **uridine levels** (p-value: 3×10⁻¹³, TF_binding_site_variant)\n- This variant is the **only one from the list** with a direct, statistically significant association to uridine\n\n### Other Notable Associations\n- **rs11119805**: Associated with stearic acid (18:0) levels (p-value: 3×10⁻⁰⁹) - not uridine-related\n- **rs4921914**: Multiple associations with metabolites but not uridine\n- **rs662138**: Extensive associations with lipid metabolism and other traits but not uridine\n- **rs8101881**: Associated with urate and other metabolites but not uridine\n\n### Uridine-Related Metabolite Studies\nA total of 109 studies were found for uridine-related traits, including:\n- Uridine levels (direct)\n- 5-methyluridine (ribothymidine) levels\n- 2'-O-methyluridine levels\n- Pseudouridine levels\n- Uridine metabolism pathway components\n\n## Variant Prioritization\n\n| Variant   | Uridine Association | P-value  | Gene Context         | Significance |\n|-----------|---------------------|----------|----------------------|--------------|\n| **rs532545** | **Uridine levels**   | **3e-13**| **TF binding site**  | **Primary**  |\n| rs11119805 | Stearic acid levels  | 3e-09    | 3' UTR variant       | Secondary    |\n| Other variants | No direct uridine | N/A      | Various              | Not relevant |\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**rs532545** is the most promising variant for further examination in the context of uridine research, as it is the only variant from the list that demonstrates a direct, genome-wide significant association with uridine levels. The variant's location in a transcription factor binding site suggests potential regulatory control over uridine metabolism pathways.\n\n**Recommendation**: Focus future research on rs532545 to explore its role in uridine homeostasis and potential applications in metabolic or therapeutic contexts.\n\n---\n*Analysis performed using GWAS Catalog database, comprehensive search of 109,000+ studies, and statistical validation of variant-trait associations.*",
