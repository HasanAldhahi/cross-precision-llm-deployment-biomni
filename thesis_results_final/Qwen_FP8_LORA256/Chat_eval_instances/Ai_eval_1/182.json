[✓] Convert Ensembl gene IDs to gene symbols for easier interpretation 3. [✓] Query databases to find associations between phenotypes and candidate genes 4. [✓] Analyze the associations to identify the most likely causal gene 5. [✓] Provide the final answer in the required format Based on my comprehensive analysis, I have identified the causal gene by matching the patient's phenotype profile with known genetic syndromes. The patient presents with a complex phenotype including: - Intellectual disability and global developmental delay - Multiple craniofacial abnormalities (macroglossia, narrow palate, depressed nasal bridge, dysmorphic features) - Skeletal dysplasia and delayed maturation - Organomegaly (hepatomegaly, splenomegaly) - Hearing impairment and dental malocclusion - Behavioral abnormalities (hallucinations, atypical behavior, seizures) Among the candidate genes, **MAN2B1 (ENSG00000104774)** is associated with alpha-mannosidosis, a lysosomal storage disease that presents with exactly this constellation of features. The other candidate genes cause different syndromes that do not comprehensively match the patient's phenotype profile. <solution> {'causal_gene': ['ENSG00000104774']} </solution>",
