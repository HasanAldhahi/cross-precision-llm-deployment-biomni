The candidate gene ENSG00000102452 corresponds to NALCN (sodium leak channel, non-selective) 2. From the OMIM database, I found that NALCN is associated with two diseases: - Congenital contractures of the limbs and face, hypotonia, and developmental delay (OMIM: 616266) - Hypotonia, infantile, with psychomotor retardation and characteristic facies 1 (OMIM: 615419) 3. The patient has multiple phenotypes including: - Contractures (HP:0000205) - Hypotonia (HP:0000343) - Developmental delay (HP:0000293) - Psychomotor retardation (HP:0000470) - Facial anomalies (HP:0001181) - Ataxia (HP:0001250) - Dolichocephaly (HP:0001270) 4. From the literature search, I found that CLIFAHDD syndrome is associated with NALCN variants and includes the phenotypes: Congenital contractures, Limb defects, Face anomalies, Hypotonia, Ataxia, Developmental delay, and Dolichocephaly. The patient's phenotype pattern matches CLIFAHDD syndrome (OMIM: 616266) which is \"Congenital contractures of the limbs and face, hypotonia, and developmental delay\". Let me provide the final answer in the required format. </think> <solution> {'disease_name': 'Congenital contractures of the limbs and face, hypotonia, and developmental delay', 'OMIM_ID': '616266'} </solution>",
