ALK is directly associated with neuroblastoma susceptibility, and neuroblastoma is a type of nervous system tumor that commonly occurs in children. This represents a direct match between the patient's primary diagnosis and the gene's known association. The secondary neurological phenotypes (seizures, hyperactivity, hyperkinetic movements) are consistent with nervous system tumor manifestations. <solution> {'causal_gene': ['ENSG00000171094']} </solution>",
