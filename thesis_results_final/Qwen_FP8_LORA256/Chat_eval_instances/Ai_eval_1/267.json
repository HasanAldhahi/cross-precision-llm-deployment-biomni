The candidate gene ENSG00000109063 corresponds to MYH3 gene 2. From the OMIM data, I found that CANT1 gene is associated with Desbuquois dysplasia 1 (OMIM ID: 251450) 3. The patient has phenotypes including: - Short neck, Short stature, Microcephaly, Mental retardation - Hypotonia, Joint laxity, Developmental delay, Muscle weakness - Short limbs These phenotypes are consistent with Desbuquois dysplasia 1, which is characterized by skeletal dysplasia, developmental delays, hypotonia, joint laxity, and other features that match the patient's presentation. The diagnosis appears to be Desbuquois dysplasia 1 with OMIM ID 251450. Let me provide the final answer in the requested format.</think> <solution> {\"disease_name\": \"Desbuquois dysplasia 1\", \"OMIM_ID\": \"251450\"} </solution>",
