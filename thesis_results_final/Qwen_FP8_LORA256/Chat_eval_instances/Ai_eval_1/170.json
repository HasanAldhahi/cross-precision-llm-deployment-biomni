So the answer is ENSG00000171714 (ANO5).</think> Based on my systematic analysis of the patient's phenotypes and candidate genes: **Plan:** 1. [✓] Convert HP phenotype codes to human-readable descriptions (completed) 2. [✓] Convert Ensembl gene IDs to gene symbols for easier interpretation (completed) 3. [✓] Search literature for connections between the phenotypes and candidate genes (completed) 4. [✓] Query databases for gene-phenotype associations (completed) 5. [✓] Analyze the evidence to identify the most likely causal gene (completed) **Key Findings:** - The patient presents with classic Miyoshi muscular dystrophy phenotypes: distal lower limb muscle weakness, muscle fiber splitting, flexion contractures, and elevated creatine kinase concentration - ANO5 (ENSG00000171714) is specifically associated with Miyoshi muscular dystrophy 3 (OMIM: 613319) and muscular dystrophy, limb-girdle, autosomal recessive 12 (OMIM: 611307) - Literature confirms ANO5 mutations cause anoctamin-5 muscular dystrophy with phenotypes matching this patient's presentation - Other candidate genes are associated with different conditions (Townes-Brocks syndrome, metabolic disorders, nephrotic syndrome, etc.) that don't match the muscle-related phenotype pattern The evidence clearly indicates that the patient's phenotype pattern is most consistent with ANO5-related Miyoshi muscular dystrophy. <solution> {'causal_gene': ['ENSG00000171714']} </solution>",
