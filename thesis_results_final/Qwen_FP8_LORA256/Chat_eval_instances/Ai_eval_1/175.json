From the OMIM data, I found that ENSG00000130707 (ASS1) is associated with \"Citrullinemia, 215700 (3), Autosomal recessive\" 3. ASS1 (Argininosuccinate synthase 1) is the enzyme responsible for converting citrulline to argininosuccinate in the urea cycle. When this enzyme is defective, it causes citrullinemia, which is characterized by elevated citrulline levels in the blood. 4. The patient's phenotypes are consistent with citrullinemia/urea cycle disorder: - Elevated plasma citrulline (HP:0011966) is the direct match - Hyperammonemia (HP:0001987) is a common feature of urea cycle disorders - Hepatic failure (HP:0001399) can occur in urea cycle disorders - Gastrointestinal symptoms like vomiting and reflux are also common The other candidate genes are associated with different conditions that don't match this phenotype pattern as well: - DVL1: Robinow syndrome - BBS9: Bardet-Biedl syndrome - RBM28: Cardiomyopathy - RBM20: Cardiomyopathy - SLC3A2: No phenotypes found - ZNF629: No phenotypes found - PIGN: Multiple congenital anomalies - SHPK: Sedoheptulokinase deficiency Sedohpexin (SHPK) is also a metabolic enzyme, but it's involved in sedoheptulose metabolism, not the urea cycle. The direct match with citrullinemia makes ASS1 the clear choice. The answer should be: {'causal_gene': ['ENSG00000130707']} </think> <solution> {'causal_gene': ['ENSG00000130707']} </solution>",
