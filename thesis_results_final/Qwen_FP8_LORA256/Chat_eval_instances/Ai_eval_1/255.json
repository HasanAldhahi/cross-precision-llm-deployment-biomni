The candidate gene ENSG00000143368 corresponds to SF3B4 2. SF3B4 is associated with \"Acrofacial dysostosis 1, Nager type\" with OMIM ID 154400 3. The patient's phenotypes include various features that are consistent with Nager syndrome: - HP:0200006: Slanting of the palpebral fissure - HP:0007646: Absent lower eyelashes - HP:0011800: Midface retrusion - HP:0000347: Micrognathia - HP:0012478: Temporomandibular joint ankylosis - HP:0000185: Cleft soft palate - HP:0000365: Hearing impairment - HP:0009778: Short thumb - HP:0002974: Radioulnar synostosis - HP:0001263: Global developmental delay - HP:0012385: Camptodactyly - HP:0001762: Talipes equinovarus - HP:0012210: Abnormal renal morphology - HP:0001629: (not found in HPO data) The phenotypes show a clear pattern of: - Craniofacial abnormalities (slanting palpebral fissures, absent eyelashes, midface retrusion, micrognathia, cleft palate) - Limb abnormalities (radioulnar synostosis, short thumb, camptodactyly, talipes equinovarus) - Hearing impairment - Developmental delay - Abnormal renal morphology This constellation of features is very characteristic of Nager syndrome, which is also known as Nager acrofacial dysostosis. The OMIM ID is 154400 for this condition. Let me provide the final answer in the requested format.</think> <solution> {'disease_name': 'Nager acrofacial dysostosis', 'OMIM_ID': '154400'} </solution>",
