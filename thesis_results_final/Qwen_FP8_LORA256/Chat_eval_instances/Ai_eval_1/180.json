Let me update my plan and provide the final answer.</think> **Plan:** 1. [✓] Look up phenotype descriptions for all HP codes 2. [✓] Analyze candidate genes and their associations with these phenotypes 3. [✓] Determine the most likely causal gene based on phenotype matching 4. [ ] Output the result in the required format Based on my analysis, the evidence strongly points to IDS as the causal gene: **Key findings:** - The patient has multiple phenotypes characteristic of mucopolysaccharidosis, including: - HP:0008155 (Mucopolysacchariduria) - a direct indicator of mucopolysaccharidosis - HP:0000280 (Coarse facial features) - HP:0000457 (Depressed nasal ridge) - HP:0005280 (Depressed nasal bridge) - HP:0000687 (Widely spaced teeth) - HP:0000470 (Short neck) - HP:0001744 (Splenomegaly) - From DisGeNET data, mucopolysaccharidosis II is associated with the IDS gene - From OMIM data, IDS gene is associated with \"Mucopolysaccharidosis II, 309900 (3), X-linked recessive\" - IDS (ENSG00000010404) is one of the candidate genes provided The combination of mucopolysacchariduria and the classic facial dysmorphism features strongly suggests Hunter syndrome (Mucopolysaccharidosis II), which is caused by mutations in the IDS gene. <solution> {'causal_gene': ['ENSG00000010404']} </solution>",
