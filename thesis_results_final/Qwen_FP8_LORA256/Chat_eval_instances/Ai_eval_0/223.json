Direct presence in DisGeNET hemoglobinuria disorder associations\n2. Biological relevance as a major blood protein affected by hemolysis\n3. Literature support for albumin's role in PNH pathogenesis and treatment monitoring\n4. The central role of complement-mediated hemolysis in PNH, which would directly impact albumin levels\n\n## Final Answer\n\n**ALB** (albumin) is the most likely causal gene for paroxysmal hemoglobinuria in this locus.",
