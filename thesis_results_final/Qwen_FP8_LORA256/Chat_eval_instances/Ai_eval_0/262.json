The phenotype pattern of distal joint contractures, ptosis, respiratory insufficiency, and scoliosis is most characteristic of Marden-Walker syndrome, which is known to be associated with PIEZO2 mutations. The most likely diagnosis is Marden-Walker syndrome with OMIM ID 248700.</think> I have successfully identified the disease by analyzing the patient's phenotypes and the candidate gene. Let me update my plan and provide the final answer. **Updated Plan:** 1. [✓] Convert the candidate gene (ENSG00000154864) to a gene symbol (PIEZO2) 2. [✓] Look up the gene in OMIM database to find associated diseases 3. [✓] Convert the HP terms to their corresponding phenotype names 4. [✓] Match the phenotypes with the disease to make a diagnosis 5. [✓] Return the result in the required format The analysis shows that the patient has a pattern of phenotypes including distal joint contractures, ptosis, respiratory insufficiency, and scoliosis, which is characteristic of Marden-Walker syndrome. This syndrome is associated with mutations in the PIEZO2 gene (ENSG00000154864). <solution> { \"disease_name\": \"Marden-Walker syndrome\", \"OMIM_ID\": \"248700\" } </solution>",
