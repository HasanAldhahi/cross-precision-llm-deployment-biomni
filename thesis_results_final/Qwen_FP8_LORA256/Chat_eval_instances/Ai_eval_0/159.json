So the causal gene is ENSG00000012061.</think> **Plan:** 1. [✗] Look up the phenotype descriptions for the given HP codes (failed because BiomniClient is not available) 2. [✓] Load and examine the OMIM dataset for disease-gene associations 3. [✓] Load and examine the gene_info dataset 4. [✓] Analyze phenotype-gene associations to identify the most likely causal gene 5. [✓] Provide the final answer in the required format Based on my systematic analysis of the OMIM dataset and gene information, I identified that the patient's phenotype profile shows multiple central nervous system abnormalities including: - Cerebral cortical atrophy (HP:0002120) - Atrophy/Degeneration affecting central nervous system (HP:0007367) - Hypoplastic hippocampus (HP:0025517) - Abnormal corpus callosum morphology (HP:0001273) - Conductive hearing impairment (HP:0000405) - Increased skull ossification (HP:0004330) - Peripheral neuropathy (HP:0009830) - Cranial nerve paralysis (HP:0006824) Among the candidate genes, ENSG00000012061 is specifically associated with \"Cerebrooculofacioskeletal syndrome 4\" in the OMIM database, which comprehensively matches the patient's constellation of CNS abnormalities, brain structural issues, and developmental problems. Other genes showed more limited phenotype associations (e.g., ataxia, epilepsy, or specific organ systems). <solution> {'causal_gene': ['ENSG00000012061']} </solution>",
