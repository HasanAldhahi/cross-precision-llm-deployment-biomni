The patient's phenotype HP:0001276 exactly matches this disease name. Final result: {'disease_name': 'Intellectual developmental disorder', 'OMIM_ID': '300354'} </observation> [114] ASSISTANT: <think> I need to find the specific disease associated with the candidate gene and the given phenotypes. From the OMIM data, I found that CUL4B is associated with \"Intellectual developmental disorder, X-linked syndromic, Cabezas type\" and the MIM Number is 300304.0. The OMIM ID appears to be 300354. The patient's phenotypes include: - HP:0001276: Intellectual developmental disorder, X-linked syndromic, Cabezas type - HP:0001270: - HP:0002378: - HP:0000750: - HP:0001263: The first phenotype exactly matches the disease name associated with CUL4B. This is a rare X-linked syndromic intellectual developmental disorder. Let me provide the final answer in the required JSON format. </think> <solution> {\"disease_name\": \"Intellectual developmental disorder\", \"OMIM_ID\": \"300354\"} </solution>",
