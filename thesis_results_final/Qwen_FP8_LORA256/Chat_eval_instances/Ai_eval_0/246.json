The candidate gene ENSG00000154864 corresponds to PIEZO2 2. The patient has the following phenotypes: - HP:0009473: Joint contracture of the hand - HP:0001371: Flexion contracture - HP:0000602: Ophthalmoplegia - HP:0002650: Scoliosis - HP:0000508: Ptosis 3. PIEZO2 is associated with several diseases: - Arthrogryposis, distal, type 5 (OMIM: 108145) - Arthrogryposis, distal, with impaired proprioception and touch (OMIM: 617146) - Arthrogryposis, distal, type 3 (OMIM: 114300) - Marden-Walker syndrome (OMIM: 248700) 4. The constellation of phenotypes - multiple joint contractures (hand and flexion contractures), ophthalmoplegia, scoliosis, and ptosis - is most characteristic of Marden-Walker syndrome. Marden-Walker syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by: - Joint contractures (arthrogryposis) - Ophthalmoplegia (eye muscle paralysis) - Ptosis (drooping eyelids) - Scoliosis - Developmental delays - Characteristic facial features This matches the patient's phenotype constellation better than the other PIEZO2-associated conditions, which are primarily arthrogryposis types without the full constellation of eye and spinal abnormalities seen in this patient. The answer should be: {'disease_name': 'Marden-Walker syndrome', 'OMIM_ID': '248700'}</think> <solution> {'disease_name': 'Marden-Walker syndrome', 'OMIM_ID': '248700'} </solution>",
