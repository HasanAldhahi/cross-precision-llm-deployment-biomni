I have a list of 25 HPO phenotype terms 2. I have a list of 16 candidate genes 3. From the OMIM data, I found that several candidate genes have known phenotype associations 4. The GNAS gene (ENSG00000087460) is associated with McCune-Albright syndrome, which is characterized by a constellation of phenotypes including: - Craniofacial abnormalities (micrognathia, cleft palate, absent lower eyelashes, cleft lip) - Growth/developmental issues (short stature, developmental delay, intellectual disability) - Endocrine abnormalities (hypoparathyroidism, hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, hypothyroidism, hypopituitarism) - Other features (hearing impairment, seizures, speech delay, etc.) 5. The other candidate genes are associated with different conditions: - KRAS: Various cancers and Noonan syndrome - CUL3: Neurodevelopmental disorder and Pseudohypoaldosteronism - PCSK1: Obesity and endocrinopathy - CDC73: Hyperparathyroidism and parathyroid disorders - RB1: Retinoblastoma and various cancers - HBB: Hemoglobin disorders 6. The phenotype pattern provided matches McCune-Albright syndrome very closely, which is caused by GNAS gene mutations. Therefore, the causal gene is GNAS (ENSG00000087460).</think> <solution> {'causal_gene': ['ENSG00000087460']} </solution>",
