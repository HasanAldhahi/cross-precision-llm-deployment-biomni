Let me summarize the key evidence: 1. ESR1 has 8 direct breast cancer-related associations in the knowledge graph (MONDO) 2. ESR1 has 3 breast cancer associations in OMIM 3. ESR1 appears in 661 knowledge graph entries related to breast cancer 4. ESR1 encodes the estrogen receptor alpha (ERα), which is one of the most well-known and important breast cancer genes 5. ESR1 is used clinically as a biomarker for breast cancer subtypes and treatment response 6. The other genes (CCDC170, ARMT1, RMND1, SYNE1, ZBTB2) have much weaker or no direct breast cancer associations The evidence is overwhelming that ESR1 is the causal gene for breast cancer in this locus.</think> I have found very clear evidence that ESR1 is the most likely causal gene for breast cancer. Let me provide a structured search query for ClinVar to find ESR1 breast cancer variants. <solution> # Search for ESR1 breast cancer variants in ClinVar { \"search_term\": \"ESR1[gene] AND breast%20cancer[dis]\" } </solution>",
