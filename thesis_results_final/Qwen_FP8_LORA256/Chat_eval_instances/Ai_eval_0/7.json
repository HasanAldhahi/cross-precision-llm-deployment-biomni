Systematic search of GWAS Catalog data from the biological data lake (622,784 studies)\n2. Targeted API queries for L-Alanine/L-Asparagine phenotype associations\n3. Examination of 11 candidate variants across multiple metabolite and phenotype databases\n4. Prioritization based on statistical significance and biological relevance\n\n## Key Findings\n\n### Primary Candidate: rs13538\n**Rank: 1** - Most promising variant\n\n**Direct Amino Acid Associations:**\n- **n-acetylasparagine levels**: P-value = 5×10⁻³⁰³ (extremely significant)\n- **urine n-acetylphenylalanine levels**: P-value = 4×10⁻⁸⁰ (highly significant)\n- **urine oxindolylalanine levels**: P-value = 0.0 (maximum significance)\n- **n-acetylcitrulline levels**: P-value = 5×10⁻³⁰³ (extremely significant)\n- **methionine sulfone levels**: P-value = 6×10⁻¹⁰⁹ (highly significant)\n\n**Statistical Strength:**\n- 37 total associations found\n- Multiple associations with P-values exceeding genome-wide significance thresholds\n- Consistently significant across different metabolite platforms and populations\n\n### Secondary Candidates\n**rs174548**: 275 associations, primarily with lipid metabolism  \n**rs7157785**: 63 associations, including some metabolite studies  \n**rs750472**: 10 associations, with blood metabolite levels  \n\nThese variants showed broader metabolite associations but lacked the direct amino acid specificity demonstrated by rs13538.\n\n## Biological Rationale\n\nrs13538 demonstrates direct associations with amino acid metabolites that are biologically relevant to the L-Alanine/L-Asparagine phenotype:\n\n1. **n-acetylasparagine** - Directly related to asparagine metabolism\n2. **phenylalanine pathway** - Connected to alanine biosynthesis pathways\n3. **citrulline** - Involved in amino acid metabolism and the urea cycle\n4. **methionine** - Key amino acid in protein synthesis and metabolism\n\nThe consistent associations with multiple amino acid-related metabolites suggest rs13538 is likely to be functionally relevant to amino acid metabolism pathways.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**rs13538** is the most promising variant for further examination due to its:\n- Direct associations with amino acid metabolites (asparagine, phenylalanine, citrulline, methionine)\n- Exceptionally significant P-values (5×10⁻³⁰³, 4×10⁻⁸⁰)\n- Strong biological relevance to the target phenotype\n- Consistent replication across multiple studies and populations\n\nThis variant warrants prioritization for functional validation studies and deeper mechanistic investigation into amino acid metabolism pathways.",
