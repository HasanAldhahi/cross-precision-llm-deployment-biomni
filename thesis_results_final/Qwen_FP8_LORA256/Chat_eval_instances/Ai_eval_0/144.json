MYO5A (ENSG00000197535) - Griscelli syndrome type 1 2. TBCE (ENSG00000284770) - Kenny-Caffey syndrome, Hypoparathyroidism-retardation-dysmorphism syndrome 3. SUFU (ENSG00000107882) - Joubert syndrome, Basal cell nevus syndrome, Medulloblastoma 4. RPS6KA3 (ENSG00000177189) - Coffin-Lowry syndrome, Intellectual developmental disorder From the analysis, MYO5A (Griscelli syndrome) shows the most comprehensive match to the patient's phenotypes: - Neurological features: Ataxia, Lethargy, Ventriculomegaly, Congenital stationary night blindness - Developmental features: Growth delay, Feeding difficulties in infancy - Craniofacial features: Abnormal facial shape, Pectus excavatum, Epicanthus - Respiratory features: Dyspnea Griscelli syndrome type 1 is known to cause a complex multisystem disorder with the full spectrum of these symptoms, making MYO5A the most likely causal gene. The other genes have more limited phenotype matches: - TBCE (Kenny-Caffey) mainly affects growth, bones, and parathyroid, but doesn't typically include the full neurological spectrum - SUFU (Joubert) has neurological features but lacks the specific craniofacial and developmental pattern - RPS6KA3 (Coffin-Lowry) has developmental and facial features but lacks the neurological components So the answer should be ENSG00000197535 (MYO5A).</think> <solution> { \"causal_gene\": [\"ENSG00000197535\"] } </solution>",
