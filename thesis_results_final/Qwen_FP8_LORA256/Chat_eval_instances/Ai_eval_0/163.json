Let me provide the final answer in the required format.</think> Based on my systematic analysis of the patient phenotypes and candidate genes: **Plan:** 1. [✓] Convert HPO phenotype IDs to human-readable descriptions 2. [✓] Convert Ensembl gene IDs to gene symbols and get gene information 3. [✓] Query databases to find associations between the phenotypes and candidate genes 4. [✓] Analyze the associations to identify the most likely causal gene 5. [✓] Output the result in the required format **Analysis Summary:** - Analyzed 21 candidate genes against 17 HPO phenotype IDs - Found that KCNH2 (ENSG00000055118) is associated with Short QT syndrome 1 and Long QT syndrome 2 in OMIM - KCNH2 encodes potassium voltage-gated channel, subfamily H, member 2 (human ether-a-go-go-related gene) - Patient phenotypes include multiple arrhythmia-related terms (HP:0001640, HP:0004751, HP:0011675) - QT syndromes caused by KCNH2 mutations can manifest as various arrhythmias - Other candidate genes either don't have phenotype associations or don't match the observed phenotypes KCNH2 is the most likely causal gene because it directly matches the cardiac arrhythmia phenotypes observed in the patient, while other genes don't show associations with the specific phenotypes presented. <solution> {'causal_gene': ['ENSG00000055118']} </solution>",
