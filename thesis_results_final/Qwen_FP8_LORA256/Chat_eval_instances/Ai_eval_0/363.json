  "last_200_tokens": "in Primary Human Keratinocytes\" - Mentions RNP delivery to keratinocytes 5. \"A biodegradable lipid nanoparticle delivers a Cas9 ribonucleoprotein for efficient and safe in situ genome editing in melanoma\" - Mentions LNP delivery of Cas9 RNP From the literature results, I can see that: - Ribonucleoprotein (RNP) delivery is specifically mentioned for skin stem cell editing in mouse models - Electroporation is mentioned for keratinocyte editing - In vivo delivery is mentioned for skin stem cell editing The question asks for the most suitable method for mouse skin editing. Based on the literature, ribonucleoprotein delivery appears to be the most suitable method because: 1. It's specifically mentioned for in vivo skin stem cell editing in mouse models 2. It's used for efficient gene editing in skin cells 3. Multiple papers mention RNP delivery for skin editing applications Let me provide the final answer.</think> Based on my systematic analysis of the literature on CRISPR delivery methods for mouse skin editing, I found multiple relevant studies. The most suitable delivery method appears to be ribonucleoprotein (RNP) delivery, which is specifically mentioned in several papers for efficient in vivo gene editing in skin stem cells and epidermal cells of mouse models. <solution>ribonucleoprotein delivery</solution>",
