ENSG00000179941 (BBS10): Bardet-Biedl syndrome 10 - This syndrome includes obesity, eye problems, polydactyly, and other features that match several of the patient's phenotypes 2. ENSG00000164961 (WASHC5): Ritscher-Schinzel syndrome 1 - Includes heart defects and eye problems 3. ENSG00000141431 (ASXL3): Bainbridge-Ropers syndrome - Includes developmental delays and other features 4. ENSG00000175426 (PCSK1): Obesity susceptibility - Matches obesity but not the full constellation 5. Other genes have more limited phenotype matches The patient's phenotype constellation is very characteristic of Bardet-Biedl syndrome, which includes: - Eye abnormalities (retinal dystrophy, microphthalmia) - Polydactyly/webbing of fingers - Obesity/metabolic features - Dental abnormalities - Ectodermal dysplasia - Genital abnormalities (cryptorchidism/testicular descent issues) - Heart defects - Nail abnormalities - Developmental delays - Seizures This matches almost perfectly with the patient's phenotypes. BBS10 is the gene associated with Bardet-Biedl syndrome 10, which is autosomal recessive. Therefore, the causal gene is BBS10 (ENSG00000179941).</think> <solution> {'causal_gene': ['ENSG00000179941']} </solution>",
