The Ensembl gene ID for GLE1 is ENSG00000119392. Final answer: ENSG00000119392 </observation> [66] ASSISTANT: <think>Based on my analysis, I need to identify the causal gene from the candidate list that is associated with both HP:0001263 (Global developmental delay) and HP:0001270 (Motor delay). From my research: 1. The candidate gene ENSG00000119392 corresponds to GLE1 gene 2. GLE1 is associated with two diseases: - Lethal congenital contracture syndrome 1 (MIM: 253310) - Congenital arthrogryposis with anterior horn cell disease (MIM: 611890) 3. The disease \"lethal arthrogryposis-anterior horn cell disease syndrome\" (MONDO:0012750) has both required phenotypes: - HP:0001270 (Motor delay) - HP:0001263 (Global developmental delay) 4. This disease is associated with GLE1 gene (ENSG00000119392) Therefore, the causal gene is ENSG00000119392 (GLE1).</think> <solution> { \"causal_gene\": [\"ENSG00000119392\"] } </solution>",
