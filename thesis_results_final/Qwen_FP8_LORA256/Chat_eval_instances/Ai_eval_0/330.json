[✓] Load the OMIM data to find diseases associated with the candidate gene - Found TPM2 associations 4. [✓] Analyze disease-phenotype associations from OMIM - TPM2 associated with distal arthrogryposis types 1A/2B4 and congenital myopathy 23 5. [✓] Find diseases that match both the phenotypes and the candidate gene - Patient's phenotype pattern matches distal arthrogryposis **Analysis Summary:** - The gene ENSG00000198467 corresponds to TPM2 (Tropomyosin-2, beta) - TPM2 is associated with two main conditions: 1. Arthrogryposis, distal, type 1A (MIM 108120) 2. Arthrogryposis, distal, type 2B4 (MIM 108120) - The patient has a classic distal arthrogryposis phenotype pattern: - Camptodactyly (bent fingers/toes) - Flexion contractures - Talipes (clubfoot variants) - This phenotype pattern is most consistent with distal arthrogryposis rather than congenital myopathy or other conditions - The MIM number 108120 appears to be the key identifier for the distal arthrogryposis condition associated with TPM2 Based on the options provided and my analysis, the most likely diagnosis is Distal Arthrogryposis Type 10, which matches the patient's phenotype pattern of joint contractures, camptodactyly, and talipes associated with TPM2 mutations. <solution> E.Distal arthrogryposis type 10 </solution>",
