[✓] Look up the meaning of the HP phenotype codes to understand the patient's symptoms 2. [✓] Convert the Ensembl gene IDs to gene symbols for easier interpretation 3. [✓] Query databases (OMIM, DisGeNET) to find gene-disease associations 4. [✓] Match the phenotypes to the candidate genes to identify the most likely causal gene 5. [✓] Output the result in the required format Based on my comprehensive analysis of the patient's phenotypes and candidate genes: 1. The patient's HP codes indicate a muscular dystrophy syndrome with: - Muscle weakness (HP:0001324) - Skeletal muscle atrophy (HP:0003202) - Cardiac involvement (cardiomegaly, sudden cardiac death, arrhythmia) 2. I analyzed all candidate genes and found that ANO5 (ENSG00000171714) has the strongest evidence for association with muscular dystrophy conditions: - OMIM: Muscular dystrophy, limb-girdle, autosomal recessive 12 - DisGeNET: 14 different muscular dystrophy conditions - Perfect match with the patient's phenotype profile 3. Other candidate genes had significantly fewer or no direct associations with the specific muscular dystrophy phenotypes shown by the patient. The evidence clearly points to ANO5 as the causal gene for this patient's condition. <solution> {'causal_gene': ['ENSG00000171714']} </solution>",
