ENSG00000072121 (Zinc finger FYVE domain-containing protein 26) - Associated with Spastic paraplegia 15, autosomal recessive 2. ENSG00000148384 (Inositol polyphosphate-5-phosphatase, 72kD) - Associated with Joubert syndrome 1 3. ENSG00000105877 (Dynein, axonemal, heavy chain-11) - Associated with Ciliary dyskinesia, primary, 7 The patient shows a clear neurological phenotype cluster: - Motor polyneuropathy (HP:0007178) - Ataxia (HP:0001251) - Spasticity (HP:0001257) - Myoclonus (HP:0001336) - Dyssynergia (HP:0010867) - Difficulty walking (HP:0002355) Among the candidates: - ENSG00000072121 is associated with Spastic paraplegia 15, which directly explains spasticity, ataxia, difficulty walking, and dyssynergia - ENSG00000148384 is associated with Joubert syndrome 1, which can cause ataxia but typically includes other features like intellectual disability - ENSG00000105877 is associated with Ciliary dyskinesia, which can cause neurological symptoms but is more associated with respiratory issues ENSG00000072121 appears to be the best match because spastic paraplegia directly explains the patient's neurological phenotype cluster of spasticity, ataxia, difficulty walking, and dyssynergia. </think> <solution> {'causal_gene': ['ENSG00000072121']} </solution>",
