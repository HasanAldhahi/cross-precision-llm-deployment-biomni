The evidence strongly supports ADA2 deficiency (DADA2) as having scleroderma-like manifestations, particularly affecting vascular and connective tissue systems.\n\nThe pathogenic variant query returned a specific variant in KCNA2, but this gene was not part of the original locus provided in the task.",
