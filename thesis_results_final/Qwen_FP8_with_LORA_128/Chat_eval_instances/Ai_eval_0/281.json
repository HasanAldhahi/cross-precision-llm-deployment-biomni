[✓] Identify which method has been most successfully used for mouse liver editing (completed) 4. [✓] Provide the final recommendation based on evidence (ready to complete) From the literature search results, I found several key papers: 1. **Nanoblades** - \"Nanoblades allow high-level genome editing in murine and human organoids\" (PMID: 37435135) - This paper specifically demonstrates that nanoblades work efficiently for both murine and human organoids. 2. **Lentiviral transduction** - \"High Efficiency Lentiviral Transduction of Colon Organoids Using Reversible 2D/3D Culture Techniques\" (PMID: 40163310) - This shows lentiviral methods are effective for colon organoids. 3. **AAV delivery** - \"Synergistic enhancement of AAV gene delivery in 2D cells and 3D organoids using polybrene and hydroxychloroquine\" (PMID: 41237131) - Indicates AAV works in 3D organoids. 4. **RNP/mRNA electroporation** - Multiple papers show this method works well with organoids, particularly when combined with nanoblades technology. The evidence strongly suggests that **nanoblades**, which combine RNP/mRNA delivery with electroporation techniques, are particularly effective for human organoids. This method allows for high-level genome editing and has been specifically optimized for organoid systems. <solution> c. RNP/mRNA electroporation </solution>",
