Direct Functional Relationship\n- **C4A and C4B** are the only genes in the locus that directly encode complement component 4 (C4) protein\n- Both genes are part of the RCCX (RP-C4-CYP21-TNX) module in the MHC region\n- However, **C4A deficiency** shows stronger associations with circulating C4 protein level changes\n\n### 2. Literature Evidence\n- Multiple studies demonstrate that **C4A deficiency** is associated with reduced circulating C4 protein concentrations\n- The paper \"Complement C4 gene copy numbers modulate serum immune protein profiles in patients with first-episode psychosis and healthy controls in a sex-specific manner\" (PMID: 41092761) shows direct associations between C4 gene copy numbers and serum protein profiles\n- Studies consistently mention **C4A** more frequently than C4B in relation to circulating protein levels\n\n### 3. Biological Mechanism\n- C4A and C4B are highly homologous genes with similar protein products\n- C4A contains a promoter within intron 35 that initiates abundant adrenal-specific transcription\n- C4A deficiency has been linked to various clinical conditions affecting protein homeostasis\n\n### 4. Neonatal Relevance\n- The complement system is active during pregnancy and influences neonatal outcomes\n- Studies show that complement component 4 levels are developmentally regulated\n- C4A's role in protein production makes it the most biologically plausible candidate\n\n## Analysis of Other Genes\n- **C4B**: While it also encodes C4 protein, it showed less frequent associations with circulating protein levels in the literature\n- **Other genes in the locus** (AGER, AGPAT1, ATF6B, etc.): No direct evidence linking them to complement component 4 protein concentration\n\n## Conclusion\n**C4A** is the most likely causal gene for neonatal circulating Complement Component 4 protein concentration based on:\n1. Direct encoding of C4 protein\n2. Stronger literature associations with circulating protein levels\n3. Known functional differences between C4A and C4B\n4. Biological plausibility in neonatal protein homeostasis\n\nThe evidence supports C4A as the primary genetic determinant of circulating complement component 4 protein concentration in neonates.",
