It directly relates to gastroparesis through its associations with diabetes and metabolic disorders 2. Gastroparesis is commonly caused by diabetes mellitus affecting gastric motility 3. PPARG regulates insulin sensitivity and metabolic processes 4. Other candidate genes are associated with conditions (ciliary dyskinesia, intellectual disability) that don't align as closely with the patient's phenotypes The answer is <solution> {'causal_gene': ['ENSG00000132170']} </solution>",
