Phosphate metabolism is closely related to citric acid metabolism (both are involved in metabolic pathways) 3. It shows up in multiple GWAS datasets with consistent associations Let me provide a concise summary of this finding.</think> <solution> Based on my systematic analysis of GWAS data for variants associated with citric acid levels, I identified rs34100980 as the most promising candidate from the provided list.
