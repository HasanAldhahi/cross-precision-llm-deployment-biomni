I'll provide the solution in the required format.</think> Based on my comprehensive analysis of the patient's phenotypes and candidate genes, I have identified the causal gene by systematically matching the patient's clinical features with known gene-phenotype associations. **Plan:** 1. [✓] Loaded and parsed HPO terms to understand the patient's phenotypes 2. [✓] Converted Ensembl gene IDs to gene symbols using OMIM data 3. [✓] Searched for gene-phenotype associations in OMIM and knowledge graph 4. [✓] Matched patient phenotypes with candidate gene associations 5. [✓] Identified the most likely causal gene based on phenotype matches **Key Findings:** - The patient's core phenotype is **congenital nephrotic syndrome** (HP:0008677) - **WT1** (ENSG00000184937) is the only candidate gene directly associated with congenital nephrotic syndrome - WT1 mutations cause **Denys-Drash syndrome**, which includes: - Nephrotic syndrome (direct match) - Cognitive impairment (matches HP:0100543) - Growth abnormalities (matches HP:0004322 - Short stature) - Failure to thrive (matches HP:0001508) - Other systemic features that could explain additional phenotypes While other genes like F13B, GP9, and ZIC1 could explain individual phenotypes, **WT1 provides the most comprehensive explanation** for the patient's phenotype profile, with congenital nephrotic syndrome being the definitive matching feature. <solution> {'causal_gene': ['ENSG00000184937']} </solution>",
