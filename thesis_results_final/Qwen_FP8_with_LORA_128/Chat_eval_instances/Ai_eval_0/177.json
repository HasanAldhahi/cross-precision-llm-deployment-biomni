I should provide the final answer in the required JSON format with the causal gene.</think> Based on my systematic analysis of the patient's phenotypes and candidate genes: **Plan Update:** 1. [✓] Loaded and understood the patient phenotypes (HP codes) 2. [✓] Converted HP codes to human-readable phenotype descriptions 3. [✓] Loaded gene information for the candidate genes 4. [✓] Queried databases for gene-disease associations related to these phenotypes 5. [✓] Analyzed which candidate gene has the strongest association with the patient's phenotypes 6. [✓] Identified the causal gene The patient presents with a constellation of phenotypes including progressive cerebellar ataxia, dysmetria, dysdiadochokinesis, motor delay, neurodevelopmental delay, autistic behavior, schizophrenia, hearing impairment, and dysmorphic facial features (long face, high palate). From the 12 candidate genes found in OMIM, TBP (ENSG00000112592) is the only gene associated with spinocerebellar ataxia 17 (SCA17), which matches 10+ of the patient's key phenotypes. The literature search confirmed multiple studies demonstrating TBP mutations cause SCA17 with the exact neurological and psychiatric phenotype profile seen in this patient. <solution> {'causal_gene': ['ENSG00000112592']} </solution>",
