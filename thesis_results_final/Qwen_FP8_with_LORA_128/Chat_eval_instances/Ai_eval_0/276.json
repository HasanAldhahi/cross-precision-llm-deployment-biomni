This variant is classified as \"Pathogenic\" with clinical significance. 2. Variant ID 41741: This appears to be TSC2:c.4285G>T (p.Ala1429Ser) which has aliases including \"p.A1429S:GCC>TCC\". This variant is classified as \"Benign/Likely benign\". The user is asking specifically about A1326S, and from the results, I can see that there are multiple variants with this amino acid change in different genes. The most relevant result appears to be variant 67840 which has A1326S as an alias and is classified as \"Pathogenic\". Let me extract this information and provide it to the user in the requested format.</think> I found the clinical significance classification for the A1326S variant. Based on the search results, I can see that this variant appears in multiple genes with different classifications: - In SCN5A gene: The variant is classified as **Pathogenic** (last evaluated: 2014/10/02) - In TSC2 gene: The variant is classified as **Benign/Likely benign** (last evaluated: 2025/08/01) The most relevant result appears to be the pathogenic classification in SCN5A, which has the alias \"p.A1326S:GCC>TCC\" and is directly classified as pathogenic. <solution> { \"search_term\": \"A1326S[variant] AND clinsig[prop]\", \"pathogenicity_classification\": \"Pathogenic\", \"gene\": \"SCN5A\", \"variant_id\": \"VCV000067840\", \"last_evaluated\": \"2014/10/02\" } </solution>",
