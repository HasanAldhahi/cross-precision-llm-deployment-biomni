[✓] Loaded HPO data to understand phenotype codes 2. [✓] Loaded gene-disease association data from OMIM 3. [✓] Mapped candidate genes to their associated phenotypes 4. [✓] Compared patient phenotypes with gene-associated phenotypes 5. [✓] Identified the most likely causal gene based on phenotype overlap **Analysis Summary:** - Patient presents with 23 phenotype codes predominantly involving neurological and developmental abnormalities - Key phenotypes include intellectual disability, brainstem underdevelopment, hearing impairment, spasticity, hemiplegia, and muscle weakness - Among the 10 candidate genes analyzed, only RPS6KA3 (ENSG00000177189) showed significant phenotype overlap - RPS6KA3 is associated with Coffin-Lowry syndrome and intellectual developmental disorder, X-linked 19 - This gene matches 7 of the patient's neurological/developmental phenotypes - Other candidate genes showed minimal or no phenotype overlap with the patient's presentation The causal gene is RPS6KA3, which corresponds to the Ensembl ID ENSG00000177189. </think> <solution> {'causal_gene': ['ENSG00000177189']} </solution>",
