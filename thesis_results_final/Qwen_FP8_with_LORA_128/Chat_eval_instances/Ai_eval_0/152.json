[✓] Check which candidate genes have phenotype information in OMIM 3. [✓] Analyze the patient's phenotype profile and identify potential matches 4. [✓] Get detailed information about BRAF-related RASopathies to confirm match 5. [✓] Check other candidate genes for potential matches to patient phenotype Based on my analysis, the patient's phenotype profile is highly characteristic of Cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome, which is one of the RASopathies associated with BRAF mutations. The patient's phenotypes include: - Central nervous system abnormalities (Dandy-Walker malformation, cerebellar hypoplasia, corpus callosum hypoplasia, brainstem hypoplasia, hydrocephalus) - Congenital heart defects (atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect) - Developmental delay and intellectual disability - Seizures - Multiple congenital anomalies - Growth hormone deficiency and hypoglycemia This pattern of multiple congenital anomalies affecting the CNS, heart, and development is classic for Cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome, which is associated with BRAF gene mutations. From the OMIM data, I found that BRAF (ENSG00000157764) is associated with Cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome, LEOPARD syndrome 3, and Noonan syndrome 7 - all RASopathies that can present with similar phenotypes. <solution> {'causal_gene': ['ENSG00000157764']} </solution>",
