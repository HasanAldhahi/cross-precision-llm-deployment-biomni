Among all candidate genes, **FOXE1** is the only gene associated with a syndrome (Bamforth-Lazarus) that can have neurological manifestations, and it's also associated with thyroid cancer which could potentially explain nervous system neoplasms through paraneoplastic mechanisms. <solution> { \"causal_gene\": [\"ENSG00000178919\"] } </solution>",
