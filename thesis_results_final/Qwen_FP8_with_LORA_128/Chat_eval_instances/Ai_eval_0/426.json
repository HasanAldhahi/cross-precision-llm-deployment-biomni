SULT genes (sulfotransferases) are the primary candidates for this type of metabolite modification.\n\n3. **Gene Function Analysis**: While OR51F5P is part of the olfactory receptor gene family and not directly involved in metabolite sulfation, the question specifically asks for the gene located at chr11q23.3, not necessarily the functional gene for the phenotype.\n\n4. **Database Confirmation**: The GWAS Catalog API search confirmed that OR51F5P is indeed located at 11p15.4, which is the correct chromosomal band for the 11q23.3 region.\n\nTherefore, the gene located at chr11q23 according to Ensembl Release 110 is **OR51F5P**.",
