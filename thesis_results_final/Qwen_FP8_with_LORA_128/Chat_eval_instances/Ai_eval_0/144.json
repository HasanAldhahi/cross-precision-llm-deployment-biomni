[✓] Look up the meaning of the HP phenotype terms (completed) 2. [✓] Convert Ensembl gene IDs to gene symbols for easier analysis (completed) 3. [✓] Analyze the function of each candidate gene (completed) 4. [✓] Match phenotypes to gene functions to identify the causal gene (completed) 5. [ ] Provide the final answer in the required format The patient exhibits a combination of neurological phenotypes including: - Ventriculomegaly (brain ventricle enlargement) - Ataxia (movement coordination issues) - Congenital stationary night blindness - Optic disc drusen - Lethargy - Growth delay Among the candidate genes, TBCE is associated with \"Encephalopathy, progressive, with amyotrophy and optic atrophy\" which matches the patient's clinical presentation: - Progressive encephalopathy can explain ventriculomegaly and brain dysfunction - Amyotrophy can contribute to movement issues and ataxia - Optic atrophy explains the optic disc drusen and night blindness <solution> {'causal_gene': ['ENSG00000284770']} </solution>",
