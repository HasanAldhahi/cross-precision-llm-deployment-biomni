[✓] Convert HPO codes to human-readable phenotypes 2. [✓] Convert Ensembl gene IDs to gene symbols 3. [✓] Search for diseases associated with the candidate genes 4. [✓] Identify the most likely disease based on phenotype pattern 5. [✓] Find the specific OMIM ID for the identified disease 6. [✓] Verify the gene-disease association and provide final answer Based on my analysis, I can see that PIEZO2 (ENSG00000154864) is strongly associated with distal arthrogryposis type 5 (OMIM ID 108145). The patient's phenotypes include multiple features consistent with distal arthrogryposis: - Dolichocephaly (HP:0000268) - Broad forehead (HP:0000337) - Brachydactyly (HP:0001156) - Tetralogy of Fallot (HP:0001636) - Abnormality of the supraorbital ridges (HP:0100538) These phenotypes align with the diseases associated with PIEZO2 in the Ensembl database. The specific OMIM ID for distal arthrogryposis type 5 is 108145, which matches what I found earlier. <solution> {'causal_gene': ['ENSG00000154864']} </solution>",
