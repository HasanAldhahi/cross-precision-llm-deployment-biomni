Let me analyze the biological functions and vaccine connections I found: **Plan:** 1. [✓] Search for the specific gene set THAKAR_PBMC_INACTIVATED_INFLUENZA_AGE_21_30YO_VS_70PLS_0DY_UP 2. [✓] Look up biological functions of each candidate gene 3. [✓] Search for literature connecting genes to vaccine responses 4. [ ] Analyze which gene is most relevant to vaccine response differences 5. [ ] Provide final answer From my analysis: - **IL13RA2**: Interleukin 13 receptor subunit alpha 2 - involved in immune responses, found in HIV vaccine strategy literature - **HTR2C**: 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 2C - involved in neurotransmission, no vaccine connections found - **LRCH2**: Leucine rich repeat containing 2 - unknown function, no clear connections - **RBMXL3**: RNA binding motif protein X-linked like 3 - involved in RNA binding, no vaccine connections found The gene set THAKAR_PBMC_INACTIVATED_INFLUENZA_AGE_21_30YO_VS_70PLS_0DY_UP is about vaccine response differences between young adults and seniors. IL13RA2 is the only gene that showed clear connections to vaccine responses and immune system function. <solution> {\"causal_gene\": [\"IL13RA2\"]} </solution>",
