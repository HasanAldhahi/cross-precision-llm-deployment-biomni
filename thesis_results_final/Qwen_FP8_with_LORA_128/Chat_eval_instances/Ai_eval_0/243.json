The patient has multiple phenotypes related to fatty liver disease: - HP:0002650: Elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST) - HP:0000175: Fatty liver disease - HP:0007099: Abnormal liver function - HP:0004322: Abnormal liver function test - HP:0001263: Abnormal blood test - HP:0009473: Abnormal blood chemistry 3. From the OMIM database, I found that PIEZO2 is associated with: - Fatty liver disease, susceptibility to, 1 (OMIM: 613282) - Fatty liver disease, susceptibility to, 2 (OMIM: 613387) 4. The literature search confirms that these phenotypes are consistent with fatty liver disease/NAFLD The patient has a classic presentation of fatty liver disease with elevated liver enzymes, abnormal liver function tests, and abnormal blood chemistry. The candidate gene PIEZO2 is associated with fatty liver disease susceptibility. Between NAFLD1 (OMIM 613282) and NAFLD2 (OMIM 613387), I need to choose the most appropriate one. Since the patient has the full phenotype cluster of fatty liver disease with elevated liver enzymes and abnormal blood tests, and given that NAFLD1 is typically the more common/susceptibility form, I'll go with NAFLD1 (OMIM 613282) as the diagnosis.</think> <solution> {'disease_name': 'Fatty liver disease, susceptibility to 1', 'OMIM_ID': '613282'} </solution>",
