This conclusion is based on direct evidence from recent research demonstrating PAM's critical role in pancreatic β-cell function and diabetes pathogenesis.\n\n## Key Findings\n\n### PAM - Strong Evidence for Diabetes Causality\n- **Direct therapeutic target identification**: Recent multi-omics Mendelian randomization study explicitly identified PAM as a potential therapeutic target for Type 2 diabetes [1]\n- **β-cell expression**: PAM is expressed in over 80% of pancreatic β-cells, indicating its functional relevance to insulin production\n- **Disease-associated expression changes**: PAM expression is significantly downregulated in islets of diabetic mice, linking its expression levels to diabetes progression\n- **Functional mechanism**: Molecular docking simulations revealed high-affinity interaction between PAM and oleic acid, a metabolite associated with β-cell function\n- **Causal validation**: Pharmacological PAM inhibition in INS1 β-cells induced deficits in cell proliferation and survival, demonstrating its indispensable role in β-cell integrity\n\n### Other Candidate Genes - Limited Evidence\n- **GIN1, MACIR**: Primarily associated with hypertension in published studies, with no clear connection to Type 2 diabetes\n- **SLCO4C1**: Related to drug transport mechanisms rather than disease causation\n- **PPIP5K2**: Found in keratoconus studies with only indirect mentions in diabetes research through pancreatic cancer contexts\n\n## Biological Mechanism\n\nPAM functions as peptidylglycine α-amidating monooxygenase, playing a crucial role in the post-translational modification of peptides. Its high expression in pancreatic β-cells and direct involvement in insulin secretion pathways make it biologically plausible as a diabetes causative gene. The downregulation of PAM in diabetic models suggests it may contribute to β-cell dysfunction, a core pathophysiological mechanism in Type 2 diabetes.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**PAM** is the most likely causal gene for Type 2 diabetes in this locus, supported by direct functional evidence, β-cell-specific expression, and mechanistic connections to diabetes pathogenesis.\n\n---\n\n**References:**\n[1] Multi-omics Mendelian randomization study revealing PAM as a potential therapeutic target for type 2 diabetes (PMID: 41063246)",
