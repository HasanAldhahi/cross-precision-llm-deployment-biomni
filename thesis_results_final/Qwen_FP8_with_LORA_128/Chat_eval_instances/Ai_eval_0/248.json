This appears to be the correct diagnosis for the patient. Let me provide the final answer in the required format.</think> Based on my analysis, I have identified the disease: **Plan:** 1. [✓] Load and interpret the HPO phenotype codes to understand the patient's symptoms 2. [✓] Identify the candidate gene using UniProt query (ENSG00000142798 = MYH3) 3. [✓] Search OMIM database for diseases associated with the candidate gene 4. [✓] Match the phenotypes to the disease to make a diagnosis 5. [✓] Format the output as required The candidate gene ENSG00000142798 corresponds to MYH3 (myosin heavy chain 3). From the OMIM database, I found that MYH3 is associated with \"Contractures, pterygia, and spondylocarpostarsal fusion syndrome 1A\" with OMIM ID 178110. Literature search confirmed that MYH3 mutations cause \"contractures, pterygia, and spondylocarpostarsal fusion syndrome 1\". The patient's phenotypes (HP:0002098, HP:0001252, HP:0000160, HP:0001357, HP:0001363, HP:0000274, HP:0045025, HP:0012745, HP:0003196, HP:0000463, HP:0000396, HP:0000369, HP:0001601, HP:0001371) are consistent with this rare disease, which is characterized by contractures, pterygia, and spondylocarpostarsal fusion. <solution> { \"disease_name\": \"Contractures, pterygia, and spondylocarpostarsal fusion syndrome 1\", \"OMIM_ID\": \"178110\" } </solution>",
