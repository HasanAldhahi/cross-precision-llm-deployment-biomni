I need to see what the options are, but they weren't provided in the current conversation. Let me assume I need to provide this result as the answer. Since the user asked for the longest ORF and its amino acid sequence, I should provide this information in the solution format.</think> I have successfully analyzed the DNA sequence and found the longest ORF. Let me provide the final answer: **Plan:** 1. [✓] Analyze DNA sequence for ORFs using manual start-stop codon detection 2. [✓] Identify the longest ORF based on nucleotide sequence length 3. [✓] Translate the longest ORF to amino acid sequence 4. [✓] Provide the result in the required format <solution> The longest ORF in the given DNA sequence starts at position 246 and ends at position 450, with a length of 204 nucleotides.
