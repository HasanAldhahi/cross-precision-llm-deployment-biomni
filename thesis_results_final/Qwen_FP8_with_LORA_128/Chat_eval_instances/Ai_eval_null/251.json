The specific type (1A vs 2B4) might be difficult to determine without more specific information, but type 1A is generally considered the classic form of distal arthrogryposis. Let me provide the diagnosis with the disease name and OMIM ID.</think> Based on my analysis of the patient's phenotypes and the candidate gene, I can now provide the diagnosis. **Plan Update:** 1. [✓] Look up the phenotypes (HP codes) to understand clinical features 2. [✓] Convert Ensembl gene ID to gene symbol (TPM2) 3. [✓] Query OMIM database for diseases associated with the candidate gene 4. [✓] Match phenotypes with gene-associated diseases to find the correct diagnosis 5. [✓] Format output as requested The candidate gene ENSG00000198467 corresponds to TPM2 (Tropomyosin-2, beta), which is associated with: - Arthrogryposis, distal, type 2B4, 108120 - Arthrogryposis, distal, type 1A, 108120 - Congenital myopathy 23, 609285 The patient's phenotypes include multiple camptodactyly features (permanently flexed fingers/toes) and other joint contractures, which are characteristic of distal arthrogryposis. Given that both types 1A and 2B4 share the same OMIM ID and the phenotypes are consistent with the classic presentation of distal arthrogryposis, I provide the diagnosis below. <solution> {'disease_name': 'Arthrogryposis, distal, type 1A', 'OMIM_ID': '108120'} </solution>",
