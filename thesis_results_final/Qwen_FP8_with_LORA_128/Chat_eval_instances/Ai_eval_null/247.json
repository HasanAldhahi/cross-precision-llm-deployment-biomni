[✓] Converted Ensembl gene ID to gene symbol:\n   - ENSG00000109063: MYH3 (myosin heavy chain 3)\n\n3. [✓] Query OMIM database for diseases associated with the candidate gene:\n   - Found that MYH3 is associated with several diseases including \"Contractures, pterygia, and spondylocarpostarsal fusion syndrome 1A, 178110\"\n\n4. [✓] Match the phenotypes with the diseases to find the correct diagnosis:\n   - The patient's phenotypes (cryptorchidism, narrow mouth, scoliosis, camptodactyly) are consistent with the MYH3-related disease\n   - Literature search confirmed that MYH3 mutations cause \"contractures, pterygia, and spondylocarpostarsal fusion syndrome 1\"\n\n5. [✓] Found the specific disease and OMIM ID\n\nThe final answer is:\n- Disease name: Contractures, pterygia, and spondylocarpostarsal fusion syndrome 1A\n- OMIM ID: 178110\n\nI have successfully completed the plan and found the diagnosis.
