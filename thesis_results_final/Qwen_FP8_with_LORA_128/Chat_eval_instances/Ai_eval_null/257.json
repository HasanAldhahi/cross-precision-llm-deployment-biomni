Let me check the key information I've gathered: **Candidate gene:** ENSG00000102452 (NALCN - Sodium leak channel, nonselective) **Patient's phenotypes:** - HP:0000205: Hypotonia - HP:0000343: Congenital contractures of the limbs and face - HP:0002086: Developmental delay - HP:0000347: Characteristic facies - HP:0002987: Psychomotor retardation **NALCN-associated diseases from OMIM:** 1. Congenital contractures of the limbs and face, hypotonia, and developmental delay (OMIM ID: 616266) 2. Hypotonia, infantile, with psychomotor retardation and characteristic facies 1 (OMIM ID: 615419) The patient's phenotype combination matches exactly with OMIM ID 615419: \"Hypotonia, infantile, with psychomotor retardation and characteristic facies 1\" <solution> { \"disease_name\": \"Hypotonia, infantile, with psychomotor retardation and characteristic facies 1\", \"OMIM_ID\": \"615419\" } </solution>",
