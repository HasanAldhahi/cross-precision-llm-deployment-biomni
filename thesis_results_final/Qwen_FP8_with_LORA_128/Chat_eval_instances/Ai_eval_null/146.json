The analysis found that RPS6KA3 is associated with \"Coffin-Lowry syndrome\" and \"Intellectual developmental disorder, X-linked 19\" in the literature 4. The patient's phenotype pattern (facial dysmorphism + neurological features + eye abnormalities) is very characteristic of Coffin-Lowry syndrome 5. Literature search confirmed that RPS6KA3 mutations cause Coffin-Lowry syndrome 6. Other genes don't match this phenotype pattern as well - they're associated with different conditions like Griscelli syndrome, Kenny-Caffey syndrome, heart malformations, metabolic disorders, etc. Based on this analysis, RPS6KA3 appears to be the most likely causal gene given the patient's phenotype constellation is consistent with Coffin-Lowry syndrome, which is caused by RPS6KA3 mutations.</think> I've analyzed the patient's phenotypes and candidate genes through multiple databases and literature sources. The patient exhibits a constellation of facial dysmorphism (upslanded palpebral fissures, hypertelorism, epicanthus, frontal bossing), neurological features (ataxia, lethargy, growth delay), and eye abnormalities (optic disc drusen) that are characteristic of Coffin-Lowry syndrome. The literature analysis revealed that RPS6KA3 mutations cause Coffin-Lowry syndrome, which matches the patient's phenotype pattern. Other candidate genes are associated with different conditions that don't align as closely with the observed phenotypes. <solution> {'causal_gene': ['RPS6KA3']} </solution>",
