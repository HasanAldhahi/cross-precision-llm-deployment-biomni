  "last_200_tokens": "phenotypes correspond to joint contractures, pterygia, skeletal abnormalities, short stature, joint stiffness, contractures of fingers and toes, and pterygium of fingers and toes This matches perfectly with \"Contractures, pterygia, and spondylocarpotarsal fusion syndrome 1B\" which has OMIM ID 618469. So the diagnosis should be: - Disease name: Contractures, pterygia, and spondylocarpotarsal fusion syndrome 1B - OMIM ID: 618469</think> Based on my comprehensive analysis of the patient's phenotypes and the candidate gene ENSG00000109063 (MYH3), I can now provide the diagnosis. **Final Diagnosis:** The patient presents with phenotypes including: - Joint contractures (HP:0012385, HP:0000343, HP:0002650) - Pterygia (HP:0000365, HP:0006380, HP:0001371) - Skeletal dysplasia (HP:0000160) - Short stature (HP:0000028) - Joint stiffness (HP:0000750) These clinical features are consistent with **MYH3-related contracture syndromes**. Through literature searches and OMIM database analysis, I identified that MYH3 variants cause multiple related conditions, including: 1. Contractures, pterygia, and variable skeletal fusions syndrome 1B (autosomal recessive) 2. Contractures, pterygia, and spondylocarpotarsal fusion syndrome 1B, OMIM ID: 618469 The specific syndrome mentioned in the literature as being caused by recessive MYH3 variants is \"Contractures, pterygia, and variable skeletal fusions syndrome 1B\", which matches the patient's phenotype profile perfectly. <solution> {'disease_name': 'Contractures, pterygia, and spondylocarpotarsal fusion syndrome 1B', 'OMIM_ID': '618469'} </solution>",
