Let me provide a concise summary of what has been accomplished and the key findings.</think> Looking at the observations, I need to summarize what has been accomplished in diagnosing the rare disease based on phenotypes and candidate genes. **Plan Summary:** 1. [✓] Loaded OMIM dataset from biological data lake 2. [✓] Queried OMIM data for gene-disease associations 3. [✓] Identified candidate gene ENSG00000154864 corresponds to PIEZO2 4. [✓] Found PIEZO2 is associated with arthrogryposis and Marden-Walker syndrome 5. [✓] Verified these associations match the patient's phenotypes **Key Findings:** - Candidate gene ENSG00000154864 corresponds to PIEZO2 (Piezo-type mechanosensitive ion channel component 2) - PIEZO2 gene mutations cause autosomal recessive disorders characterized by: - Joint contractures (arthrogryposis) - Intellectual disability - Facial abnormalities - Skeletal deformities - These phenotypes align with Marden-Walker syndrome or PIEZO2-related arthrogryposis <solution> Based on the OMIM dataset analysis, the candidate gene ENSG00000154864 corresponds to PIEZO2.
