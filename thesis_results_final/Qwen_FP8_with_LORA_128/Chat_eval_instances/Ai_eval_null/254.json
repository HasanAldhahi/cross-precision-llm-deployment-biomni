So the diagnosis should be: - Disease name: Intellectual developmental disorder, X-linked syndromic, Cabezas type - OMIM ID: 300354 - Gene: CUL4B Let me format this as the required output.</think> **Plan:** 1. [✓] Look up the HPO codes to understand the patient's phenotypes 2. [✓] Identify the candidate gene using the Ensembl ID (CUL4B) 3. [✓] Query OMIM database for diseases associated with this gene 4. [✓] Match the phenotypes with the diseases to find the most likely diagnosis 5. [ ] Format the output as required Based on my analysis: - The candidate gene ENSG00000158290 corresponds to CUL4B - CUL4B is associated with \"Intellectual developmental disorder, X-linked syndromic, Cabezas type\" with OMIM ID 300354 - The patient's phenotypes (hypertonia, motor delay, hand tremor, delayed speech and language development, dull intelligence) are consistent with this diagnosis <solution> {'disease_name': 'Intellectual developmental disorder, X-linked syndromic, Cabezas type', 'OMIM_ID': '300354'} </solution>",
