[✓] Identify the candidate gene from the ENSG ID (found NALCN gene) 2. [✓] Look up the phenotypes (HP codes) to understand the clinical presentation 3. [✓] Query databases to find diseases associated with both the gene and phenotypes 4. [ ] Provide the final diagnosis with disease name and OMIM ID Based on my analysis, I have found that the candidate gene ENSG00000102452 corresponds to NALCN. The patient's phenotypes (HP codes) suggest a pattern of congenital contractures, hypotonia, developmental delay, and facial abnormalities. From the OMIM database, I found that NALCN is associated with two diseases: 1. Congenital contractures of the limbs and face, hypotonia, and developmental delay (OMIM: 616266) - Autosomal dominant 2. Hypotonia, infantile, with psychomotor retardation and characteristic facies 1 (OMIM: 615419) - Autosomal recessive The pattern of multiple HP codes suggesting contractures, hypotonia, developmental delay, and facial abnormalities most closely matches the first disease: \"Congenital contractures of the limbs and face, hypotonia, and developmental delay\" with OMIM ID 616266. <solution> {'disease_name': 'Congenital contractures of the limbs and face, hypotonia, and developmental delay', 'OMIM_ID': '616266'} </solution>",
