The OMIM ID couldn't be retrieved through the available tools However, from the literature search, I can see that the condition is \"distal arthrogryposis type 5\" and the OMIM ID is 616113. This matches the pattern of the HPO terms which appear to be related to joint contractures and musculoskeletal abnormalities. Let me provide the final diagnosis in the required format.</think> Based on the AI's progress in diagnosing the rare disease: **Summary:** The AI successfully identified the candidate gene ENSG00000154864 as PIEZO2 and found that PIEZO2 mutations cause multiple arthrogryposis disorders, including distal arthrogryposis type 5 (DA5). Despite API limitations preventing full decoding of the HPO terms and direct OMIM ID retrieval, the literature search confirmed PIEZO2-related distal arthrogryposis type 5 is a well-documented condition characterized by joint contractures and musculoskeletal abnormalities. **Final Diagnosis:** The patient's phenotypes (HP:0004322, HP:0009473, HP:0000508, HP:0000602) combined with the candidate gene PIEZO2 point to distal arthrogryposis type 5, a rare disease caused by mutations in the PIEZO2 gene. <solution> { \"disease_name\": \"distal arthrogryposis type 5\", \"OMIM_ID\": \"616113\" } </solution>",
