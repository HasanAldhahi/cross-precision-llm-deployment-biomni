The study focuses on cardiometabolic traits, which are directly related to CETP function 9. No other genes from the list were found to be mentioned in the literature Based on this evidence, CETP is the most likely causal gene in the locus for the \"Multi-trait sex score\" GWAS phenotype. The literature search found CETP mentioned in the context of this specific study, and it's the only gene from the list that has direct evidence of involvement in this GWAS.</think> I have successfully identified the likely causal gene for the \"Multi-trait sex score\" GWAS phenotype. The key evidence shows that CETP (Cholesteryl Ester Transfer Protein) is the only gene from the provided list that is directly mentioned in the literature related to this GWAS study. The study (GCST90270116) involves cardiometabolic traits, and CETP is well-known for its role in lipid metabolism and cardiovascular health, making it a biologically plausible candidate. The most significant association in the study has a p-value of 4e-14, and while the authorReportedGenes array in the GWAS catalog is empty, the literature search provides clear evidence of CETP's involvement. <solution> {CETP} </solution>",
