[✓] Look up the patient's HP phenotype terms to understand the clinical manifestations 2. [✓] Create gene symbol mapping from Ensembl IDs 3. [✓] Query databases for each candidate gene's associated phenotypes and variants 4. [✓] Compare patient phenotypes with gene-associated phenotypes to identify matches 5. [✓] Determine the most likely causal gene based on phenotype overlap Based on my comprehensive analysis of the patient's phenotypes and candidate genes: **Patient's key neurological/sensory phenotypes:** - Visual impairment (HP:0000505) - Hearing impairment (HP:0000365) - Sensory neuropathy (HP:0000763) - Peripheral neuropathy (HP:0009830) - Functional abnormality of the inner ear (HP:0011389) - Abnormality of coordination (HP:0011443) - Atypical behavior (HP:0000708) **Gene analysis:** - **GALC (ENSG00000054983)**: Causes Krabbe disease, which is characterized by progressive neurological deterioration, visual and hearing loss, peripheral and sensory neuropathy, and developmental delay/atypical behavior - Other genes (RNF168, CDKN1C, AP3B1, HPS5, BLOC1S6, LRP2) cause syndromes that don't match this specific constellation of neurological/sensory symptoms The patient's phenotype pattern matches **7 out of 7 key neurological/sensory phenotypes** with Krabbe disease, making GALC the most likely causal gene. <solution> {'causal_gene': ['ENSG00000054983']} </solution>",
