From the literature searches, I found several key papers showing that: 1. Plasmid delivery is commonly used for CRISPR/dCas9-based editing in human cell lines 2. HEK293T cells are frequently used as viral producer cells 3. Circular donor plasmids improve CRISPR/Cas9-mediated homologous recombination in human cell lines 4. The innate immune response to plasmid DNA transfection has been studied in detail Biologically, HEK293T cells are: - Human embryonic kidney cells transformed with SV40 large T antigen - Adherent cells that grow well in culture - Known for high transfection efficiency with plasmids - Commonly used for transient expression of plasmids - Frequently used as producer cells for viral vectors For HEK293T cells specifically, plasmid transfection is the most relevant method because: 1. They are adherent cells, making plasmid transfection more practical than electroporation 2. They have high transfection efficiency with plasmids 3. They are commonly used for transient expression of plasmid-based CRISPR systems 4. The literature consistently shows plasmid-based delivery as the standard approach for these cells <solution> a. Plasmid Transfection </solution>",
