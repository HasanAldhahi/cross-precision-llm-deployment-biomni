RNPS1 (ENSG00000205937): No known phenotypes The pattern of phenotypes (ADHD, seizures, speech abnormalities, hypotonia, long face, hypertelorism) is most consistent with Fragile X syndrome, which is caused by mutations in the FMR1 gene. FMR1 (ENSG00000102081) is the most likely causal gene. Let me update my plan and provide the final answer.</think> I need to update my plan to reflect the analysis and provide the final answer. **Updated Plan:** 1. [✓] Look up the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) codes to understand the patient's phenotypes 2. [✓] Load the candidate genes and their associated phenotypes from the data lake 3. [✓] Match the patient's phenotypes with the candidate genes' phenotypes 4. [✓] Identify the most likely causal gene based on phenotype matching 5. [ ] Output the result in the required format Based on my analysis, the patient's phenotypes include neurological features (ADHD, seizures, abnormal speech pattern), developmental features (hypotonia), and facial features (long face, hypertelorism, abnormal frontal region shape). These phenotypes are most consistent with Fragile X syndrome, which is caused by mutations in the FMR1 gene (ENSG00000102081). <solution> {'causal_gene': ['ENSG00000102081']} </solution>",
