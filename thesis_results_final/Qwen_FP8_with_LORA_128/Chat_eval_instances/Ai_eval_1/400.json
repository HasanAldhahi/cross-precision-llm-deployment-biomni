Phenotype Understanding\nThe \"Multi-trait sex score\" is a composite measure capturing sex-related differences across multiple traits, commonly used in genetic studies to identify loci associated with sexual dimorphism or sex-specific characteristics.\n\n### 2. Gene Function Analysis\nFrom the 30 candidate genes examined, several showed potential roles in sex-related traits:\n- **CETP**: Involved in lipid metabolism and HDL cholesterol transport\n- **MT genes**: Metallothioneins involved in metal homeostasis and hormonal regulation\n- **SLC12A3**: Sodium/chloride cotransporter affecting electrolyte balance\n- **NLRC5**: NLR family member involved in immune function\n\n### 3. GWAS Association Evidence\nAnalysis of 2.6 million GWAS associations revealed the following key results:\n\n| Gene   | Sex-Related Associations | Multi-trait Sex Score P-values          | Region  |\n|--------|--------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------|\n| **CETP** | 59 (highest)            | 9.999999999999999e-31, 2e-31 (most significant) | 16q13   |\n| HERPUD1 | 27                      | 9.999999999999999e-31, 1e-10           | 16q13   |\n| SLC12A3 | 20                      | 6e-09, 3e-08                            | 16q13   |\n| NLRC5  | 19                      | 3e-08, 3e-09                            | 16q13   |\n| MT3    | 9                       | 2e-09, 5e-06 (sex hormone-binding globulin) | 2p23.3 |\n\n### 4. Biological Plausibility\nCETP's role in lipid metabolism provides strong biological plausibility for its association with sex-related traits:\n- HDL cholesterol levels show well-documented sexual dimorphism\n- Lipid metabolism pathways are known to differ between sexes\n- CETP polymorphisms have been previously linked to sex differences in lipid profiles\n\n## Conclusion\nCETP demonstrates the strongest evidence for causality in the multi-trait sex score phenotype:\n- Highest number of sex-related GWAS associations (59)\n- Most significant P-values for multi-trait sex score\n- Clear biological mechanism through lipid metabolism\n- Consistent with known sexual dimorphism in cholesterol metabolism\n\n**Final Answer: CETP**",
