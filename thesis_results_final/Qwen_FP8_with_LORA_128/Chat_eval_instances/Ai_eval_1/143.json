Neurodegeneration with ataxia, dystonia, and gaze palsy, childhood-onset 2. Frontotemporal dementia and/or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 3 This matches very well with the patient's neurological phenotype profile. The other genes are associated with different types of disorders that don't match as well with the cognitive/neurological phenotypes. The answer should be SQSTM1 with gene ID ENSG00000161011.</think> <solution> {'causal_gene': ['ENSG00000161011']} </solution>",
