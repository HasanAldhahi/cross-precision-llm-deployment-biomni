A93E has been directly associated with monogenic diabetes in multiple studies\n2. It's considered one of the most well-characterized pathogenic variants in PAX4\n3. Functional studies show it disrupts PAX4's ability to regulate insulin gene expression\n4. It has the most substantial literature evidence (10+ articles specifically mentioning A93E and diabetes)\n5. The 2022 study mentioned it as the most common pathogenic variant in PAX4\n\nThe other variants (D224G, I264V, S496L) had some evidence but not as strong as A93E. The literature search found 10+ articles for A93E and diabetes, which is the strongest evidence among all the options.\n\nSince the question asks which variant is \"most likely to be pathogenic\" and I have found substantial literature evidence for A93E, the answer should be C.</think>\n<solution>\n[ANSWER]C[ANSWER]\n</solution>",
