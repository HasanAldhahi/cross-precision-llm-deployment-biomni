  "last_200_tokens": "\"Left ventricular noncompaction 4\" with OMIM ID 613424, as this directly matches the HP:0001627 phenotype and is one of the most specific conditions listed.</think> Based on my analysis of the patient's phenotypes and the candidate gene ENSG00000101825 (ACTC1), I can provide the diagnosis. **Plan:** 1. [✓] Look up the HPO phenotype HP:0001249 to understand what it represents 2. [✓] Convert the Ensembl gene ID ENSG00000101825 to a gene symbol (ACTC1) 3. [✓] Query the OMIM database to find diseases associated with this gene and phenotype 4. [✓] Use the knowledge graph to find connections between the phenotype and gene 5. [✓] Provide the disease diagnosis with name and OMIM ID The patient has multiple cardiomyopathy-related phenotypes including left ventricular noncompaction, dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and left ventricular dilation. The candidate gene ACTC1 (cardiac muscle actin) is strongly associated with these phenotypes in both OMIM and literature databases. From OMIM data, ACTC1 is associated with: - Left ventricular noncompaction 4 (OMIM 613424) - Cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic, 11 (OMIM 612098) - Cardiomyopathy, dilated, 1R (OMIM 613424) The literature confirms that ACTC1 variants result in isolated and syndromic cardiac phenotypes, including left ventricular noncompaction cardiomyopathy. <solution> {'disease_name': 'Left ventricular noncompaction 4', 'OMIM_ID': '613424'} </solution>",
