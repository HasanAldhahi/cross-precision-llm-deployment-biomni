Phenotype Pattern Match The patient's complex phenotype with multiple skeletal dysplasia features (joint dislocation, gait ataxia, decreased body weight) plus neurological, sensory, and systemic abnormalities is characteristic of Desbuquois dysplasia/Multiple epiphyseal dysplasia [1]. ### 2. Literature Confirmation Multiple recent publications confirm CANT1 variants cause Desbuquois dysplasia and multiple epiphyseal dysplasia: - \"From Desbuquois Dysplasia to Multiple Epiphyseal Dysplasia: The Clinical Impact of a CANT1 Variant Across Five Unrelated Families\" (PMID: 39618316) - \"Clinical and Genetic Insights into Desbuquois Dysplasia: Review of 111 Case Reports\" (PMID: 39273648) - \"First Report of Two Egyptian Patients with Desbuquois Dysplasia due to Homozygous CANT1 Mutations\" (PMID: 34602954) ### 3. Unique Association CANT1 is the only candidate gene associated with the specific pattern of skeletal dysplasia and systemic features seen in this patient. ## Conclusion **CANT1 (ENSG00000171302)** is identified as the causal gene based on the strong phenotypic match with Desbuquois dysplasia and multiple epiphyseal dysplasia, confirmed literature evidence, and unique gene-phenotype association pattern. --- **References:** [1] Multiple epiphyseal dysplasia is an autosomal recessive skeletal disorder characterized by joint pain, intellectual disability, and multiple skeletal abnormalities caused by mutations in the CANT1 gene encoding calcium-activated nucleotidase 1. </think> <solution> {'causal_gene': ['ENSG00000171302']} </solution>",
