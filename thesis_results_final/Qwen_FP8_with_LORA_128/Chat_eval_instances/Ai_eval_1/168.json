The patient has a cluster of phenotypes related to limb deformities:\n   - HP:0000820: Syndactyly\n   - HP:0001627: Clubfoot\n   - HP:0001770: Metatarsus varus\n   - HP:0001339: Joint dislocation\n   - HP:0012068: Tendon abnormalities\n   - HP:0005508: Camptodactyly\n\n2. Among the candidate genes, LMBR1 (ENSG00000105983) is the only gene directly associated with syndactyly and limb deformities:\n   - LMBR1 causes Syndactyly type IV\n   - LMBR1 causes Triphalangeal thumb-polysyndactyly syndrome\n   - LMBR1 causes Laurin-Sandrow syndrome\n   - LMBR1 causes Acheiropody\n\n3. Other genes explain individual phenotypes but not the core cluster:\n   - GJB3 explains hearing loss but not the limb deformities\n   - TBP explains ataxia and movement disorders but not the limb deformities\n   - Other genes have unrelated phenotypes\n\nThe analysis clearly shows that LMBR1 is the gene that best explains the patient's phenotype cluster, particularly the syndactyly and related limb deformities.\n\nLet me provide the final answer in the required format.</think>\n<solution>\n{'causal_gene': ['ENSG00000105983']}\n</solution>",
