Searched GWAS catalog data (622,784 entries) for lysoPC(16:0) associations\n2. Checked each of the 11 target variants against lysoPC-related phenotypes\n3. Prioritized variants based on significance (P-value) and direct phenotype matching\n4. Verified associations using multiple search strategies and data validation\n\n## Conclusion\n**rs7529794** is the most promising variant for further examination due to its:\n- Direct association with lysoPC(16:0) phenotype\n- Extremely significant P-value (2 × 10⁻³⁷)\n- Multiple lysoPC-related associations indicating strong biological relevance\n- Publication in high-impact journal (Nature Genetics)\n\nThis variant represents a strong candidate for functional studies related to phospholipid metabolism and cardiovascular health.",
