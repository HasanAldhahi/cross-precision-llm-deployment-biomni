  "last_200_tokens": "\"Scalp-ear-nipple syndrome, 181270 (3), Autosomal dominant\" 4. The phenotypes match exactly with scalp-ear-nipple syndrome: - Aplasia cutis congenita of the scalp (matches HP:0002561) - Breast hypoplasia (matches HP:0001057) - Ear malformation (matches HP:0000598) The diagnosis is clear: the patient has Scalp-ear-nipple syndrome caused by variants in the KCTD1 gene, with OMIM ID 181270. Let me update my plan and provide the final answer.</think> **Plan:** 1. [✓] Look up the Human Phenotype Ontology (HP) terms to understand what phenotypes are present 2. [✓] Identify the gene corresponding to ENSG00000134504 (found to be KCTD1) 3. [✓] Search for diseases associated with these phenotypes and the identified gene 4. [✓] Find the OMIM ID for the diagnosed disease (found to be 181270) Based on my analysis: - **Gene**: ENSG00000134504 corresponds to KCTD1 (Potassium channel tetramerization domain-containing 1) - **Patient Phenotypes**: - HP:0002561: Aplasia cutis congenita of the scalp - HP:0001057: Breast hypoplasia - HP:0000598: Ear malformation - **Disease Association**: KCTD1 is associated with Scalp-ear-nipple syndrome (OMIM ID: 181270) - **Phenotype Match**: The patient's phenotypes exactly match the characteristic features of Scalp-ear-nipple syndrome: - Scalp aplasia cutis congenita (HP:0002561) - Breast anomalies/hypoplasia (HP:0001057) - Ear malformation (HP:0000598) <solution> {'disease_name': 'Scalp-ear-nipple syndrome', 'OMIM_ID': '181270'} </solution>",
