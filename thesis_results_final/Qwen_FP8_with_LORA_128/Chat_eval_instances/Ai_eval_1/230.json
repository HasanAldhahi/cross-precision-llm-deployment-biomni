Extensive database evidence across multiple sources\n2. Direct biological relevance to liver cancer mechanisms\n3. Strong literature support for its role in hepatocellular carcinoma\n4. Specific associations with liver neoplasm progression\n\nThe gene's central role in tumor angiogenesis makes it a prime candidate for driving liver neoplasm development and progression.\n\n---\n**Answer: VEGFA**",
