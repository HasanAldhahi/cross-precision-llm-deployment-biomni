Among the candidate genes, ASS1 (ENSG00000130707) is directly associated with Citrullinemia in OMIM data\n\n3. Citrullinemia is characterized by elevated plasma citrulline levels, which directly matches the patient's phenotype of \"Elevated plasma citrulline\"\n\n4. ASS1 encodes argininosuccinate synthetase 1, a key enzyme in the urea cycle. Deficiency in this enzyme causes citrullinemia.\n\nThis is a clear direct match between the patient's phenotype (elevated plasma citrulline) and the gene ASS1, which is associated with citrullinemia. The other genes don't show direct matches to the specific phenotypes presented by the patient.\n\nLet me output the result in the required format.</think>\n1. [✓] Look up the meaning of the HP phenotype codes to understand the patient's clinical presentation\n2. [✓] Retrieve information about each candidate gene and their associated phenotypes/functions\n3. [✓] Analyze the phenotype-gene associations to identify the most likely causal gene\n4.
