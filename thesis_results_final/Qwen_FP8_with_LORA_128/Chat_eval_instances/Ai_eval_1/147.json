Among the candidate genes, PNKP (ENSG00000039650) has the most comprehensive match with the patient's phenotypes:\n   - It is associated with \"Microcephaly, seizures, and developmental delay\" in OMIM\n   - It also has associations with \"Ataxia-oculomotor apraxia 4\" and \"?Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, type 2B2\"\n   - This gene matches 3 major phenotype categories and has additional relevant associations\n\n3. Other candidate genes only matched 1 phenotype category each:\n   - SPG7: spasticity/paraplegia\n   - KISS1R: hypogonadism\n   - ZIC2: holoprosencephaly\n   - TRDN: cardiac arrhythmia\n   - SETBP1: developmental delay\n\nPNKP has the broadest phenotype overlap with the patient's presentation, making it the most likely causal gene.</think>\n<solution>\n{'causal_gene': ['ENSG00000039650']}\n</solution>",
