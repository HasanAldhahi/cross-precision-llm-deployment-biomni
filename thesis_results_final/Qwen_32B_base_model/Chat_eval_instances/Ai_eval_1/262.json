I should check which disease in the Monarch response has all these HPO terms in its evidence. The first item in the result has a disease URL \"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OMIM_618458\" which corresponds to OMIM ID 618458. The evidence list includes HP:0009473, HP:0001488, HP:0002091, HP:0002650, and HP:0005745, which matches all the user's HPO terms. This seems like the correct disease. The second item has a different OMIM ID (618457) and a different set of HPO terms, so it's not a match. The third item also has a different OMIM ID (618456) and HPO terms. So, the first result is the one that matches all the given HPO terms. The disease name for OMIM 618458 is \"Familial hemiplegic migraine type 2\" (FHM2), which is caused by mutations in the PIEZO2 gene. This aligns with the candidate gene provided. Therefore, the answer should be FHM2 with OMIM ID 618458. </think> The disease associated with the gene **PIEZO2** and the provided HPO terms is **Familial hemiplegic migraine type 2** (OMIM ID 618458). <solution> {'disease_name': 'Familial hemiplegic migraine type 2', 'OMIM_ID': '618458'} </solution>",
