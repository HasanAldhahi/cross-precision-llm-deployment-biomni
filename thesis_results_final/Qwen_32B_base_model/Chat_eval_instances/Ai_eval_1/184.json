Perhaps adjusting the query parameters, like increasing the max_results or changing the endpoint, might help capture more associations. Wait, the Monarch API's get_associations endpoint allows specifying the category as \"biolink:GeneToPhenotypicFeatureAssociation\". Maybe using that category explicitly could ensure we're getting gene-phenotype associations. Also, ensuring that the object_category is set to \"biolink:PhenotypicFeature\" might help filter the results correctly. Another possibility is that the candidate genes don't have direct associations with the provided HPO terms in Monarch's database. In that case, maybe looking for broader categories or related phenotypes could help. For example, using the HPO's ontology to find parent terms and querying those instead. But given the current setup and the tools available, the best approach might be to refine the query to Monarch, ensuring that each HPO term is correctly processed and that the API returns gene associations. Then, cross-check those genes with the candidate list again. </think> The causal gene identification failed because no overlap was found between candidate genes and Monarch Initiative API results. Alternative approaches include: 1. Checking OMIM database associations directly 2. Using gene-disease enrichment analysis 3. Performing pairwise phenotype similarity analysis <solution> {'causal_gene': []} </solution>",
