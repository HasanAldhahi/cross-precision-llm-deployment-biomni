  "last_200_tokens": "deficiency is a genetic disorder. The gene responsible for A1AT is SERPINA1. The other genes in the list, like SERPINA10, 11, etc., are part of the same serpin family but code for different proteins. The GWAS Catalog query didn't return any studies, which is a bit confusing. Maybe the term \"alpha 1-Antitrypsin Deficiency\" isn't the exact name used in the database. I then tried PubMed, and the first result is a study about a novel SERPINA1 variant. This makes sense because SERPINA1 is the gene directly associated with A1AT. The other results mention the disease but not the specific gene, or they're about different topics like COVID-19 or veterinary cases. Since the user provided a list that includes SERPINA1 and the PubMed result points to SERPINA1 variants, that's the most likely candidate. The other genes in the list are either not related (like ASB2, DDX24) or part of different serpin subtypes. The GWAS might not have found a match because the disease is monogenic, and GWAS usually looks for common variants, but the key here is the direct link from the gene to the protein in the disorder. So, the answer is SERPINA1. </think> The answer is <solution> {SERPINA1} </solution>",
