Wait, maybe the user's candidate genes include a different Ensembl ID for ALDH1A3. Let me verify by checking the gene_info.parquet for ALDH1A3. If ENSG00000184254 is ALDH1A3, and it's not in the candidates, then perhaps another gene from the Monarch results is the right one. Looking at the next entry: PAX6. Its xrefs include ENSEMBL:ENSG00000171302. Oh, wait! ENSG00000171302 is the first candidate gene in the user's list. So this matches. PAX6 is associated with several HPO terms like anophthalmia, microphthalmia, etc., which are part of the user's provided terms. That seems like a strong candidate. So the causal gene is likely ENSG00000171302, which corresponds to PAX6. Let me confirm that PAX6 is indeed linked to the HPO terms provided. The Monarch results show PAX6 has phenotypes like HP:0000480 (Anophthalmia), HP:0000501 (Microphthalmia), and others that match the user's list. Therefore, ENSG00000171302 is the correct answer. </think> The causal gene is **ENSG00000171302** (PAX6), which is strongly associated with the provided HPO terms including anophthalmia, microphthalmia, and retinal coloboma. This gene appears in the Monarch Initiative results with direct matches to multiple phenotypes in the query. <solution> {'causal_gene': ['ENSG00000171302']} </solution>",
