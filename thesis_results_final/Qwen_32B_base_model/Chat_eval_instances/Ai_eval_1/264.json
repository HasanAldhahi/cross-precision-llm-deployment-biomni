  "last_200_tokens": "format, I need to ensure both fields are correctly populated. However, the Monarch result already provided the OMIM ID (OMIM:616111) and the disease name (KCTD1-related neurodevelopmental disorder). The next step is to cross-reference this information with the OMIM dataset to validate. But accessing the OMIM dataset directly isn't feasible without specific tools. Alternatively, since the query_monarch function returned the OMIM ID, maybe that's sufficient. Wait, the user might expect confirmation from another source like OMIM. Let me check if there's a way to verify using the existing functions. The query_monarch function can take an endpoint parameter. Perhaps using the OMIM endpoint or querying OMIM directly through another method. However, the available functions don't include a direct OMIM query. The Monarch result already includes the OMIM ID, so maybe that's the best we can do here. Thus, the final answer would be the disease name and OMIM ID from the Monarch result. The phenotypes provided (HP:0002561, HP:0001057, HP:0000598) should be associated with the KCTD1 gene, and the Monarch result links the gene to the specified disease. Since the Monarch query was successful, the answer is the one they provided. </think> The answer is <solution> {\"disease_name\": \"KCTD1-related neurodevelopmental disorder\", \"OMIM_ID\": \"616111\"} </solution>",
