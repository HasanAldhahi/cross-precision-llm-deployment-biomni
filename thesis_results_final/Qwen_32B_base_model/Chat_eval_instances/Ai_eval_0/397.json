  "last_200_tokens": "'source', 'category', 'version', 'creation_date', 'update_date']. So the column does exist. Then why the error in the first code attempt? Wait, in the first code, they tried to filter using df[df['gene_set_name'] == 'BRCA1_DN.V1_DN'], but maybe the dataset doesn't have any entries with that gene set name. The sample row shows 'gene_set_name' as 'BRCA1_DN.V1_DN', so perhaps there's only one entry. But when they tried to read the parquet file, maybe the actual data doesn't have that gene set. Alternatively, maybe the code is correct, but the dataset doesn't contain the required data, leading to an empty result, which would then default to option D. The user's code in the first attempt didn't find any rows, so the result is an empty list, and the code checks if the result is empty, then returns D. But the correct answer is A, B, C, or E. So there's a problem here. Wait, the user's code in the first attempt is: df = pd.read_parquet(data_lake_path) print(\"Columns in the dataset:\", df.columns.tolist()) print(\"First row sample:\", df.iloc[0].to_dict()) result = df[df['gene_set_name'] == 'BRCA1_DN.V1_DN']['gene_symbol'].unique().tolist() if not result: print(\"No genes found in the specified gene set. Defaulting to D.\") result = ['D'] print(\"The answer is <solution> \" + str(result[0]) + \" </solution></think>",
