The AI has tried converting Ensembl IDs to gene symbols using the Ensembl API but keeps getting errors. They tried different endpoints and parameters, like removing 'format=json', but it still timed out. Then they tried using a local gene_info.parquet file, but that failed because the column names didn't match. The first two rows of the parquet file showed that 'gene_id' exists but 'gene_symbol' doesn't. So the main issue is getting the gene symbols from the Ensembl IDs.\n\nThe failed steps include using the Ensembl API with incorrect endpoints and parameters, which caused 400 errors and timeouts. The local data approach also failed due to missing columns. Key findings are that the Ensembl API needs the correct endpoint without format parameters, and the parquet file doesn't have the necessary gene symbols. The next step should be to correctly use the Ensembl API by adjusting the endpoint and removing the format parameter, then proceed to map the symbols to HPO terms via OMIM or ClinVar.\n</think>\n\nThe answer is <solution> {'causal_gene': ['ENSG00000158055']} </solution>",
