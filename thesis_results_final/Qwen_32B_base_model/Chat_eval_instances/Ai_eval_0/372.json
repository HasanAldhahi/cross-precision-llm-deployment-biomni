But since the user's code already tried max_results=100 and found no matches, perhaps the issue is with the specific genes listed. Let me verify the gene symbols in the locus to ensure they're correctly formatted and present in the GWAS Catalog. Alternatively, using the gene_set_enrichment_analysis function with the provided genes and the appropriate database (like pathway or ontology) might reveal which gene is most enriched in Type 2 diabetes-related pathways. That could be another method to identify the causal gene. In summary, the next steps should involve checking DisGeNET and OMIM for gene-disease associations, verifying gene symbols, and possibly using enrichment analysis to narrow down the candidates. </think> 1.
