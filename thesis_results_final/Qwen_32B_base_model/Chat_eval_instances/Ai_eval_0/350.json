  "last_200_tokens": "which might be a university proxy. If the proxy is not working, the Ensembl API call would fail. So, the root cause is that the Ensembl API call is failing because of the proxy settings, leading to the \"Unknown gene\" message. The user might need to adjust the proxy settings or use a different method to access the Ensembl API. Alternatively, if the user can't fix the proxy, they might need to use a different approach, like using the `biopython` library to access Ensembl's database. But that's more complex. Another possibility: The Ensembl ID is correct, but the gene symbol is stored under a different format in the `gene_info.parquet`. For example, maybe the gene symbol is stored as 'TERT' but the code is expecting a different format. In conclusion, the main issue is that the Ensembl ID ENSG00000134210 is not being mapped to a gene symbol due to either a missing entry in the local data lake or a failure in the Ensembl API call due to proxy settings. The solution would involve ensuring the Ensembl ID is present in the local data or fixing the proxy settings for the API call. </think> The answer is <solution> Unknown gene </solution>",
