Li-Fraumeni syndrome is associated with TP53 mutations and includes various tumors (breast, ovarian, leukemia, etc.), which are present in the HP terms. So TP53 (ENSG00000130649) might be the causal gene here. Alternatively, AR is involved in sex development disorders, which aligns with hypogonadism, delayed puberty, etc. But the DisGeNET entry for AR is under \"46, XX Testicular Disorders of Sex Development,\" which might not directly match all the HP terms. However, the presence of multiple tumor-related HP terms suggests TP53 could be the culprit. Checking the candidate genes, TP53 is ENSG00000130649. Given the breadth of tumors listed in the phenotypes, TP53 is a likely candidate. </think> The answer is <solution> {'causal_gene': ['ENSG00000130649']} </solution>",
