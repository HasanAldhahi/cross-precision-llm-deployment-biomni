The most relevant terms are muscle weakness, developmental delay, intellectual disability, autism, speech delay, etc. The RIT1 gene has papers related to Noonan syndrome, which is a genetic disorder with developmental issues and facial features. The PMPCA gene is linked to mitochondrial diseases, which can cause muscle weakness and developmental delays. However, the PubMed results for RIT1 show more direct associations with the listed HPO terms, especially in the context of Noonan syndrome and chordoma progression. The ATP6V0A2 is linked to cutis laxa, which might not align with the given HPO terms. Since RIT1 has multiple hits in the PubMed query related to developmental and neurological issues, it's likely the causal gene here. </think> The causal gene is likely **RIT1** as it shows the strongest association with the provided HPO terms through PubMed literature. Multiple studies link RIT1 to developmental delays, autism spectrum traits, and neurological disorders (PMIDs 41136369, 41074228, 41004338), aligning with the patient's phenotypes. <solution> {'causal_gene': ['ENSG00000143622']} </solution>",
