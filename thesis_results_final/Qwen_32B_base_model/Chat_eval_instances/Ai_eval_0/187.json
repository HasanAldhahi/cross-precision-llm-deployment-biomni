  "last_200_tokens": "HPO term might have cross-references to OMIM diseases. So the correct mapping would be to look up HPO terms that are associated with the OMIM disease IDs from DisGeNET. Let me adjust the code. First, parse the OBO file to create a dictionary that maps OMIM disease IDs to their associated HPO terms. Then, for each candidate gene, retrieve its OMIM diseases from DisGeNET. For each OMIM disease, look up the associated HPO terms from the OBO dictionary and check if any of those HPO terms are in the patient's list. Count the matches for each gene. Another possible issue is that the DisGeNET dataset might not have the disease IDs in the same format as the OMIM IDs in the OBO file. For example, OMIM IDs can be in the format 'OMIM:123456' or 'OMIM:123456-78'. The code should ensure that the disease IDs from DisGeNET are in the same format as the xrefs in the OBO file. Let me modify the code to correctly parse the OBO file and create a mapping from OMIM disease IDs to HPO terms. Then, use that mapping to check for overlaps with the patient's HPO terms. </think> The answer is <solution> {'causal_gene': ['ZNF711']} </solution>",
