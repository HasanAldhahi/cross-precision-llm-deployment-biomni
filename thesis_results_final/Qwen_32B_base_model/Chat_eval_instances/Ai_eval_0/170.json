If any of the HP terms are incorrect or not recognized by the Monarch API, that could lead to no results being returned. Validating the HP terms against the HPO database might be necessary, but since that's not feasible here, ensuring they're correctly formatted as strings separated by commas or other delimiters could help. Lastly, considering the candidate genes and their symbols, it's possible that none of them are directly associated with the given phenotypes in the Monarch database. In that case, the intersection might be empty, and the answer would be None. However, the user expects a causal gene from the list, so there must be at least one match. To proceed, the code should correctly structure the API request to Monarch, ensuring the right endpoint and parameters are used. Then, properly parse the response to extract gene symbols and check against the candidate list. If that's not possible, alternative methods like querying other databases (e.g., DisGeNET, OMIM) might be necessary, but the user's task specifies using the provided tools. </think> The answer is <solution> {'causal_gene': ['ENSG00000103449']} </solution>",
