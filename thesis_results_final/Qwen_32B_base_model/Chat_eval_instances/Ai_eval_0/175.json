The other genes like PDGFRA, FIP1L1, etc., have their own counts, but the user's candidate list includes Ensembl IDs, so I need to confirm which of these IDs map to the genes mentioned in the Monarch results. Looking at the Ensembl IDs in the candidate list, ENSG00000107404 is one of them. The Monarch results show that GSX2 (which is ENSG00000107404) has 841 relevant papers, which is the highest among the listed genes. This suggests that GSX2 is the most likely causal gene here. The other genes in the Monarch results (PDGFRA, FIP1L1, etc.) are not in the user's candidate list, so they can be ignored. Therefore, the answer should be the Ensembl ID corresponding to GSX2, which is ENSG00000107404. The high number of relevant papers in the Monarch results for GSX2 supports this conclusion. I need to make sure that the output is in the correct format, as a dictionary with the key 'causal_gene' and the value as a list containing the Ensembl ID. </think> The answer is <solution> {'causal_gene': ['ENSG00000107404']} </solution>",
