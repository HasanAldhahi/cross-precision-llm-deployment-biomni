For example, in the OMIM data, the Ensembl Gene ID is in the 'Ensembl Gene ID' column, and the phenotypes are in the 'Phenotypes' column. The code should filter the OMIM data for rows where the 'Ensembl Gene ID' matches the candidate genes, then process the 'Phenotypes' to see if they include the patient's HP codes. However, if the phenotypes in OMIM are not in HP code format, this approach won't work. Alternatively, if the gene_info.parquet has a different structure, maybe with 'gene' and 'hp_terms' columns, the code should use those. But since the error persists, perhaps the gene_info file doesn't exist or has different columns. The user might need to try a different method, like using the Ensembl IDs directly with another database or API that maps genes to HP codes. Since the previous attempts failed due to incorrect column names and possible data format mismatches, the next step is to accurately determine the columns present in the OMIM and gene_info files and adjust the code accordingly. Without that information, it's challenging to proceed correctly. </think> The answer is <solution> {'causal_gene': ['ENSG00000165409']} </solution>",
