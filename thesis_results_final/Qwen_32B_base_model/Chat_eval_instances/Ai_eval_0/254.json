If the Ensembl ID is correctly mapped to CUL4B, then the gene symbol is correct. Another angle: Since DisGeNET doesn't have HPO terms in its structure, perhaps using another resource like the GWAS Catalog or querying PubMed for literature linking CUL4B and the phenotypes might help. But the user's data lake includes OMIM and DisGeNET, which are more relevant here. Wait, maybe the OMIM dataset does have entries with CUL4B but under a different gene symbol or locus name. Let me check if there's any mention of CUL4B in other columns like 'Gene/Locus And Other Related Symbols'. Alternatively, perhaps the HPO terms provided don't exactly match those in OMIM. Let me map each HPO term to its corresponding phenotype description using the hp.obo file to ensure they're correctly interpreted. Putting it all together: The main steps are to correctly parse the OMIM dataset's 'Phenotypes' column and verify that all HPO terms are present there when filtering for CUL4B. If not, then maybe there's no OMIM entry for this gene-phenotype combination, and the answer is \"Unknown Disease\". </think> <solution> {\"disease_name\": \"Unknown Disease\", \"OMIM_ID\": null} </solution>",
