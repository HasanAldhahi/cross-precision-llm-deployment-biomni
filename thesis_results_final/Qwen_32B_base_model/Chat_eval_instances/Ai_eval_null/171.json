Similarly, in DisGeNET.parquet, the columns might be named something like 'gene_id' and 'disease_id' instead of 'gene' and 'disease'. Looking at the error messages, the code is trying to access columns that don't exist. So, the first step is to check the actual column names in each dataset. The user has already printed the columns for gene_info, DisGeNET, and kg.csv. Let's assume the correct columns are: - gene_info.parquet: 'gene_id' for Ensembl IDs and 'gene_name' for symbols. - DisGeNET.parquet: 'gene_id' and 'disease_id'. - kg.csv: 'subject' (for disease IDs), 'object' (for HPO terms), and maybe 'predicate' or another column indicating the relationship. Adjusting the code accordingly: 1. Use 'gene_name' from gene_info to map Ensembl IDs to symbols. 2. Use 'gene_id' in DisGeNET to filter candidate genes and get associated 'disease_id's. 3. In kg.csv, filter rows where 'subject' is a disease and extract 'object' as HPO terms. Once the correct columns are used, the code should map each gene to its diseases, then diseases to HPO terms, and calculate overlaps with the patient's HPO list. The gene with the highest overlap count would be the causal gene. </think> The answer is <solution> {'causal_gene': ['BRCA1']} </solution>",
