Then, they attempted to load OMIM data from a parquet file but the file path was incorrect. After fixing that, they tried querying PubMed with \"MXRA5 Aniridia\" and found a study about rheumatoid arthritis, which isn't relevant. Finally, they tried Google Scholar but got an error. Since all these methods haven't yielded any useful information, maybe the answer is that there's no known association between MXRA5 and Aniridia in the current databases. The user might need to consider other approaches, like manual literature review or checking more specialized databases. But given the tools available, it seems there's no direct link. So the final answer would be that the disease can't be determined with the current data. </think> The available data and literature search results do not show a direct association between the candidate gene MXRA5 (ENSG00000101825) and the HPO term Aniridia (HP:0001249). The PubMed result found is unrelated to the iris condition, and the Google Scholar query failed. This suggests the gene-phenotype relationship is not documented in the current resources. The answer is <solution> {\"disease_name\": \"Not found in current resources\", \"OMIM_ID\": \"N/A\"} </solution>",
