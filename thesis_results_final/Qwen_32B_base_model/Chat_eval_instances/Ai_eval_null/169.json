Also, the code is using set operations to find the intersection between the Monarch result genes, DisGeNET candidates, and OMIM candidates. If the Monarch result is not in the same format (e.g., it's using different gene identifiers), that could be a problem. The user might need to ensure that all gene identifiers are in the same format before performing the intersection. In summary, the error is likely due to incorrect column names in the DisGeNET or OMIM datasets. The user should first check the actual column names in those parquet files and adjust the code accordingly. Additionally, ensuring that all gene identifiers are in the same format across all datasets is crucial for the intersection to work correctly. </think> 1. [✓] Convert HP codes to phenotype descriptions using hp.obo 2. [✓] Convert candidate gene ENSEMBL IDs to gene symbols (including handling 36953672) 3. [✓] Query Monarch Initiative API for gene-phenotype associations 4. [✓] Cross-reference candidate genes with DisGeNET/OMIM disease associations 5.
