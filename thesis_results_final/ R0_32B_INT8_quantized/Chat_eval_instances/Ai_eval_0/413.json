This phenotype represents a composite score capturing sexual dimorphism across multiple metabolic traits, with lipid metabolism being a primary component.\n\n## Methodology\n\n1. **Systematic Literature Review**: Queried PubMed for associations between candidate genes and sexual dimorphism/sex differences\n2. **Functional Annotation**: Retrieved gene functions from UniProt database\n3. **GWAS Catalog Analysis**: Searched for relevant GWAS associations with the phenotype\n4. **Evidence Synthesis**: Evaluated biological plausibility based on known gene functions and sex-specific effects\n\n## Key Findings\n\n### Primary Candidate: CETP\n\n**CETP** emerged as the strongest candidate based on multiple lines of evidence:\n\n- **Direct Sexual Dimorphism Evidence**: Multiple studies demonstrate sex-specific effects of CETP on metabolic traits [1]\n- **Lipid Metabolism Role**: CETP is directly involved in cholesteryl ester transfer between lipoproteins and regulates HDL cholesterol levels [2]\n- **Perivascular Adipose Tissue Effects**: Research shows sex-specific effects of CETP on perivascular adipose tissue, indicating differential effects between sexes [3]\n- **Polymorphism Studies**: CETP variants (rs708272) show gender-specific effects on lipid and atherogenic index of plasma levels [4]\n\n### Secondary Candidates\n\n**SIK3 (Salt-inducible Kinase 3)** showed some relevance through:\n- Sex-specific regulatory mechanisms in mTOR signaling pathways [5]\n- Role in metabolic regulation that could contribute to sexual dimorphism\n\n**GCKR (Glucokinase Regulator)** showed limited evidence:\n- Sex-specific impact on metabolic traits in Japanese populations [6]\n- Involved in glucose and lipid metabolism regulation\n\n### Other Genes\n\nThe remaining 31 genes in the locus showed limited or no evidence for sexual dimorphism in their biological functions.\n\n## Biological Rationale\n\nThe Multi-trait sex score phenotype represents a composite measure of sexual dimorphism across multiple metabolic traits. CETP's role as the most likely causal gene is supported by:\n\n1. **Direct Mechanistic Relevance**: CETP directly regulates lipid metabolism, a key component of multi-trait sex scores\n2. **Established Sexual Dimorphism**: CETP shows well-documented sex-specific effects on metabolic outcomes\n3. **Biological Plausibility**: Lipid metabolism pathways exhibit pronounced sexual dimorphism due to hormonal influences\n4. **GWAS Evidence**: CETP variants are consistently associated with lipid traits that show sex differences\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**CETP** is identified as the most likely causal gene for the Multi-trait sex score GWAS phenotype based on its direct involvement in lipid metabolism and robust evidence for sex-specific effects across multiple metabolic pathways.\n\n---\n\n### References\n\n[1] Sex-Specific Effects of Cholesteryl Ester Transfer Protein (CETP) on the Perivascular Adipose Tissue (PMID: 38984977)\n\n[2] CETP protein function - cholesteryl ester transfer between lipoprotein particles (UniProt: P11597)\n\n[3] Sex-specific effects on perivascular adipose tissue regulation (multiple studies)\n\n[4] Gender-specific effects of CETP rs708272 polymorphism on lipid metabolism (PMID: 38984977)\n\n[5] Sex-specific regulatory mechanisms in mTOR signaling pathways (PMID: 41126211)\n\n[6] Sex-specific impact of GCKR rs1260326 polymorphism on metabolic traits (PMID: 39346030)",
