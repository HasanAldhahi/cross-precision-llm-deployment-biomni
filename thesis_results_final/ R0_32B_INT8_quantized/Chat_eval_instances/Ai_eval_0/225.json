Literature search in PubMed for T-cell peripheral lymphoma associations\n2. GWAS catalog database queries for lymphoma-related genetic associations  \n3. Biological function assessment of candidate genes\n4. Cross-referencing of findings to identify the most probable causal gene\n\n## Key Findings\n\n### Literature Evidence\nCCR7 appeared in multiple research papers related to T-cell lymphoma biology:\n- \"Pathologic and molecular insights in nodal T-follicular helper cell lymphomas\" (Frontiers in Oncology, PMID: 36793612)\n- Studies showing CCR7's role in T-cell trafficking and lymph node homing\n- Papers mentioning CCR7 in context of brain tumors affecting immune cells in draining lymph nodes\n\n### GWAS Evidence\n- **KRT39**: Single association with Hodgkin's lymphoma (P-value: 4×10⁻¹¹), but primarily functions in keratin structure\n- **CCR7**: Multiple T-cell related associations in GWAS catalog:\n  - Lymphocyte percentage of white cells (P-value: 7×10⁻¹⁹)\n  - Neutrophil percentage of white cells (P-value: 4×10⁻¹⁴)\n- No direct lymphoma associations found for other genes in the locus\n\n### Biological Plausibility\nCCR7 (C-C motif chemokine receptor 7) demonstrates the strongest biological rationale:\n- Essential for T-cell migration and positioning in lymphoid tissues\n- Critical role in T-cell development and immune responses\n- Disruption of CCR7 function could impair T-cell trafficking, potentially contributing to lymphoma pathogenesis\n- Other genes (keratin genes, RARA, SMARCE1, TOP2A, etc.) lack direct mechanistic connections to T-cell lymphoma development\n\n## Candidate Gene Analysis\n\n### Strong Candidates\n- **CCR7**: Chemokine receptor with direct T-cell biology connections and literature support for lymphoma involvement\n- **KRT39**: Keratin gene with statistical association to Hodgkin's lymphoma, but limited T-cell functional relevance\n\n### Weak Candidates\n- **RARA, SMARCE1, TOP2A, CDC6**: Various cellular functions but no clear lymphoma associations found\n- **Keratin genes and KRTAP genes**: Primarily structural proteins with minimal immune system involvement\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**CCR7** emerges as the most likely causal gene for T-Cell Peripheral Lymphoma based on convergent evidence from literature, GWAS associations with immune cell populations, and direct involvement in T-cell biological processes. The gene's central role in T-cell trafficking makes it biologically plausible for contributing to T-cell lymphoma development when disrupted.\n\n---\n*Analysis of 53 genes from the locus, including 21 keratin-related genes and 12 additional candidates, using PubMed literature search and GWAS catalog database queries.*",
