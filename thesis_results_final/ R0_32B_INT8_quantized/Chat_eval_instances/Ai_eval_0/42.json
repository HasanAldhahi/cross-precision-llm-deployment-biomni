The prioritization is based on:\n\n1. **Direct Metabolic Relevance**: SLC1A4 directly transports amino acids including leucine, the precursor to ketoleucine [1]\n2. **Statistical Strength**: rs2160387 demonstrates the strongest associations with amino acid metabolites among all candidates\n3. **Pathway Specificity**: 2-aminobutyrate is a metabolite directly related to amino acid metabolism pathways that would affect ketoleucine levels [2]\n4. **Transport Mechanism**: Sodium-dependent transporters like SLC1A4 control cellular amino acid uptake and availability, directly impacting metabolic precursors [3]\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**rs2160387** is the most promising variant for ketoleucine research due to its association with SLC1A4, which provides the most direct biological mechanism affecting ketoleucine's precursor amino acids and metabolic pathways.\n\n---\n\n**References:**\n[1] SLC1A4 function as leucine transporter - amino acid transport mechanism directly relevant to ketoleucine precursor availability  \n[2] 2-aminobutyrate metabolite associations - amino acid derivative directly in pathway affecting ketoleucine metabolism  \n[3] Amino acid transport mechanism - cellular uptake control impacts metabolic substrate availability for ketone body formation",
