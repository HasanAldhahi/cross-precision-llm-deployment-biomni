Apolipoprotein B serves as the primary structural protein of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), directly influencing triglyceride and HDL cholesterol homeostasis.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**PCSK7** is the most likely causal gene for triglyceride to HDL cholesterol ratio based on:\n1. Direct GWAS associations with both HDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels\n2. Functional role in apolipoprotein B regulation\n3. Comprehensive evidence across multiple populations and studies\n\n---\n\n**References:**\n[1] *The rs508487, rs236911, and rs236918 Genetic Variants of the Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin-Kexin Type 7 (PCSK7) Gene Are Associated with Acute Coronary Syndrome and with Plasma Concentrations of HDL-Cholesterol and Triglycerides* (PMID: 34207761)\n\n[2] *PCSK7: A novel regulator of apolipoprotein B and a potential target against non-alcoholic fatty liver disease* (PMID: 37967646)\n\n[3] *Genome-wide association study of blood lipid levels in Southern Han Chinese adults with prediabetes* (PMID: 38371897)",
