Key genes identified for focused investigation included:\n\n- IL13, IL3, IL4, IL5 (interleukins with immune function)\n- CSF2, IRF1, other immune-related genes\n- Various other genes with potential inflammatory connections\n\n## Key Findings\n\n### IL13: Strong Causal Evidence\n\n**Genetic Association Studies:**\n- IL13 rs1800925 and rs1881457 variants associated with severe asthma in Western Mexican population [1]\n- IL13 gene polymorphism rs20541 linked to chronic inflammatory diseases through systematic review and meta-analysis [2]\n- IL13 variants contribute significantly to asthma severity [3]\n\n**Functional Evidence:**\n- IL13 signaling directly involved in IL-13-induced inflammatory responses in airway cells [4]\n- IL13 plays central role in asthmatic airway inflammation through multiple signaling pathways [5]\n- IL13 promotes allergic airway inflammation and airway hyperreactivity [6]\n\n**Therapeutic Relevance:**\n- IL13 signaling is a target for asthma therapeutics (tezepelumab, dupilumab)\n- IL13 antagonists used to modulate inflammatory mediators in asthma treatment\n\n### Other Interleukins: Limited Evidence\n\nWhile IL3, IL4, and IL5 also showed some connections to allergic diseases, the evidence was less compelling than IL13:\n- IL4 showed involvement in IL-13/IL4-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition\n- IL3 appeared in context of IL-33 and asthma treatment\n- No direct causal evidence found for IL5\n\n### Other Genes: Minimal Evidence\n\nThe remaining genes in the locus (ACSL6, AFF4, CCNI2, CSF2, GDF9, IRF1, KIF3A, LEAP2, P4HA2, PDLIM4, RAD50, SEPTIN8, SHROOM1, SLC22A4, SLC22A5, SOWAHA, UQCRQ) showed minimal to no direct evidence connecting them to asthma or allergic disease pathogenesis.\n\n## Clinical Significance\n\nIL13 is a Type 2 cytokine that plays a central role in allergic inflammation and asthma through:\n- Direct induction of airway inflammation\n- Promotion of mucus production and airway remodeling\n- Activation of inflammatory pathways in bronchial epithelial cells\n- Regulation of immune cell responses in allergic diseases\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**IL13** is the most likely causal gene for asthma or allergic disease in this locus, supported by robust genetic association studies, clear functional mechanisms in asthma pathogenesis, and established therapeutic relevance as a treatment target.\n\n---\n\n### References\n\n[1] Association of IL13 rs1800925 and rs1881457 variants with severe asthma in Western Mexico population  \n[2] IL-13 Gene Polymorphism (rs20541) association with chronic inflammatory diseases  \n[3] Significant contributions of interleukin-13 genotypes to asthma severity  \n[4] Phospho-proteomic analysis of IL-13 signaling in airway cells  \n[5] Mechanisms of IL13 in asthmatic airway inflammation through multiple pathways  \n[6] IL13-induced allergic airway inflammation and hyperreactivity studies",
