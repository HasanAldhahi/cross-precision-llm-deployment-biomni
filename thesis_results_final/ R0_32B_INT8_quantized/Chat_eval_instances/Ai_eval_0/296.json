The gene composition was then analyzed to determine which of the provided options (FGF16, UCK1, SV2C, PPIL1) are present in this specific gene set.\n\n## Key Findings\n\n### Gene Set Identification\n- **Gene Set**: GLI1_UP.V1_DN\n- **Collection**: C6 (oncogenic signature gene sets)\n- **Description**: Genes down-regulated in RK3E cells (kidney epithelium) over-expressing GLI1\n- **Total Genes**: 161 genes\n\n### Option Analysis\nSystematic screening of each provided option revealed:\n\n| Option | Present in GLI1_UP.V1_DN | Status |\n|--------|-------------------------|---------|\n| FGF16 | ✗ | Not present |\n| UCK1 | ✗ | Not present |\n| SV2C | ✗ | Not present |\n| **PPIL1** | **✓** | **Present** |\n\n### Gene Set Composition\nThe complete gene list includes: ACSL6, BTBD16, CACUL1, CCNL2, CD2AP, ESYT1, FOLR1, GTDC1, OPN3, PPIL1, RNF10, RUNX1, SEPTIN9, SLC22A1, SPECC1, YIPF1, ZMYND11, and 144 other genes (full list available in MSigDB C6 collection).\n\n## Conclusion\n**Answer: D. PPIL1**\n\nBased on direct analysis of the MSigDB C6 oncogenic signature gene set data, PPIL1 is the only gene among the provided options that is present in the GLI1_UP.V1_DN gene set. This finding is definitive and based on empirical data from the established oncogenic signature collection.\n\n## Evidence Summary\n- **Data Source**: MSigDB human C6 oncogenic signature gene sets [1]\n- **Gene Set Verification**: Confirmed presence and composition of GLI1_UP.V1_DN\n- **Direct Evidence**: PPIL1 was identified in the gene set through systematic screening\n- **Alternative Options**: FGF16, UCK1, and SV2C were definitively absent from the gene set\n\n---\n**References:**\n[1] MSigDB C6 collection contains 189 oncogenic signature gene sets derived from published studies, including this specific GLI1-related signature.",
