Through systematic searching of the GWAS Catalog database, **rs1171614** was identified as the most promising variant based on its association with purine metabolism pathways, which are directly relevant to uridine biology.\n\n## Methodology\n\nThe analysis involved multiple systematic approaches:\n1. Query of GWAS Catalog API for uridine-related studies\n2. Loading and examination of 622,784 GWAS associations from the biological data lake\n3. Cross-referencing 11 target variants against uridine-related phenotypes\n4. Assessment of biological pathway relevance to purine metabolism\n5. Prioritization based on metabolic context and statistical significance\n\n## Key Findings\n\n### Uridine GWAS Studies\n- **109 total uridine-related associations** identified in the GWAS catalog\n- Multiple uridine metabolite forms studied including:\n  - Uridine levels (10 studies)\n  - 5-methyluridine (ribothymidine) levels (15 studies) \n  - 2'-o-methyluridine levels (17 studies)\n  - 2'-deoxyuridine levels (15 studies)\n\n### Target Variant Analysis\nThe 11 target variants were systematically evaluated:\n\n| Variant | Primary Associations | Metabolic Relevance |\n|---------|---------------------|-------------------|\n| **rs1171614** | **Urate levels, serum uric acid levels** | **Purine metabolism** |\n| rs10741657 | Vitamin D levels, insufficiency | Vitamin D pathway |\n| rs2769264 | Body mass index, Cu levels | General metabolism |\n| rs6564851 | Carotenoid and tocopherol levels | Antioxidant pathway |\n| rs766420 | Reticulocyte count, bilirubin levels | Nucleotide metabolism |\n| rs1005390 | General metabolite levels | General metabolism |\n| Other variants | Various non-metabolic traits | Limited metabolic relevance |\n\n## Scientific Rationale\n\n### Primary Selection: rs1171614\n\n**rs1171614** was identified as the most promising variant for uridine research based on the following evidence:\n\n**Direct Evidence:**\n- **Urate levels**: P-value = 1.000000e-141 (extremely significant)\n- **Serum uric acid levels**: P-value = 2.000000e-120 (extremely significant)\n\n**Biological Justification:**\n1. **Shared metabolic pathway**: Uridine is a purine nucleoside, while urate/uric acid are terminal purine metabolites\n2. **Pathway proximity**: The purine metabolism pathway is directly relevant to uridine research\n3. **Strong statistical evidence**: Genome-wide significant associations (P < 5e-8)\n4. **Functional relevance**: Urate metabolism represents the closest biological connection to uridine among all tested variants\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWhile no target variants showed direct associations with uridine itself, **rs1171614** emerged as the most promising candidate for further examination based on its robust associations with urate levels and serum uric acid levels. These associations place it within the purine metabolism pathway, making it the most biologically relevant variant for uridine-related research among the provided options.\n\n**Recommended variant for further examination: rs1171614**",
