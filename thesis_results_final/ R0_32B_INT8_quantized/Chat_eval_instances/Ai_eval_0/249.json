Let me verify this by checking what the HPO terms mean and confirming they align with Miller syndrome.\n\nLet me quickly check the HPO terms to make sure they match Miller syndrome:\n- HP:0002561\n- HP:0000598  \n- HP:0001057\n\nAnd the gene ENSG00000134504 corresponds to DHODH, which is known to cause Miller syndrome.\n\nThe diagnosis should be:\n- Disease name: Miller syndrome\n- OMIM ID: 263750\n\nLet me provide the final answer in the requested JSON format.</think>\n<solution>\n{\"disease_name\": \"Miller syndrome\", \"OMIM_ID\": \"263750\"}\n</solution>",
