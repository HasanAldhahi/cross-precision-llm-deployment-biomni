This diagnosis is supported by complete phenotype-gene concordance and characteristic clinical features.\n\n---\n\n**References:**\n[1] Direct mapping of HPO terms to clinical features via OMIM database analysis  \n[2] Gene-disease association confirmed in OMIM database (MIM: 613420.0 for KCTD1)  \n[3] Classic triad of scalp, ear, and nipple defects as diagnostic criteria for the syndrome",
