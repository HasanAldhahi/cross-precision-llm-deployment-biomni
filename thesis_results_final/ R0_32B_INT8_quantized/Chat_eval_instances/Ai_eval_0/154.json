Specific Phenotype Matching\n- **Myoclonus**: CTNND2 is the only candidate gene directly associated with myoclonus disorders [1]\n- **Seizures**: Associated with multiple seizure types including focal seizures, generalized seizures, and infrequent generalized seizures [2]\n- **Facial features**: Linked to distinctive facial phenotypes consistent with the patient's mask-like facies [3]\n\n### 2. Inheritance Pattern Consistency\n- CTNND2 mutations cause **X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism**\n- The patient's **male-limited expression** phenotype is highly consistent with X-linked inheritance patterns\n- Other candidate genes lack evidence for X-linked inheritance mechanisms\n\n### 3. Neurological Phenotype Spectrum\n- The combination of brain malformation (Dandy-Walker), movement disorders (myoclonus), and seizures aligns with CTNND2's known neurological associations\n- Literature supports CTNND2 mutations causing complex neurological phenotypes with structural brain abnormalities\n\n### 4. Unique Gene-Phenotype Associations\n- Among all candidate genes, CTNND2 showed the most comprehensive match to the patient's unique phenotype constellation\n- No other candidate gene demonstrated associations with both myoclonus and multiple seizure types\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**CTNND2 (ENSG00000164764)** is identified as the causal gene based on:\n1. Specific associations with myoclonus and multiple seizure types\n2. Consistency with X-linked inheritance pattern (male-limited expression)\n3. Known neurological phenotypes including brain malformations\n4. Unique match to the patient's distinctive phenotype combination\n\n## References\n\n[1] CTNND2 associations with myoclonus disorders identified through DisGeNET database analysis  \n[2] Multiple seizure type associations documented in comprehensive disease-gene mapping  \n[3] Neurological phenotype spectrum consistent with known CTNND2-related X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:** {'causal_gene': ['ENSG00000164764']}",
