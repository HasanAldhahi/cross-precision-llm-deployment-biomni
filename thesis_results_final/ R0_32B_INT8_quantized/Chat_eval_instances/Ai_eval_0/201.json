Other genes (ENSG00000288695, EXOC1, EXOC1L, NMU, PDCL2, SRD5A3, TMEM165) showed limited or no direct associations with colorectal neoplasms.\n\n### Biological Pathways\n\n| Gene | Primary Function | Cancer Relevance |\n|------|------------------|------------------|\n| **CLOCK** | Master circadian rhythm regulator, transcription factor | Circadian disruption is a well-established cancer risk factor; regulates cellular senescence and aging |\n| CEP135 | Centrosomal protein, cell cycle regulation | Fundamental to cancer biology through cell division control |\n| KDR | VEGF receptor, angiogenesis regulation | Tumor progression through blood vessel formation |\n\n### Database Analysis\n\n- **GWAS Catalog**: No direct gene-specific associations found with colorectal neoplasms\n- **DisGeNET**: KDR showed associations with hemangioma but no direct colorectal cancer links\n- **Literature**: CLOCK consistently appeared in colorectal cancer research contexts\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**CLOCK** emerges as the most likely causal gene based on:\n\n1. **Strong Literature Evidence**: Multiple direct publications linking CLOCK to colorectal cancer, particularly early-onset forms and cancer immunotherapy contexts\n\n2. **Established Biological Mechanism**: Circadian rhythm disruption is a well-documented cancer risk factor, with CLOCK as the master regulator of this pathway\n\n3. **Clinical Relevance**: Recent research highlights CLOCK's role in biological aging and DNA methylation patterns associated with colorectal cancer onset\n\n4. **Pathway Specificity**: While other genes have general cancer-related functions, CLOCK shows the most specific and consistent association with colorectal neoplasms in the literature\n\nThe circadian rhythm pathway regulated by CLOCK provides a compelling biological mechanism for colorectal cancer risk, supported by multiple independent research studies.",
