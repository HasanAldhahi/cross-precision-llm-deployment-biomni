Both C4A and C4B genes encode C4 proteins, but C4A has been consistently shown to be the primary source of circulating C4 protein in neonatal and adult populations.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**C4A** is the most likely causal gene for neonatal circulating Complement Component 4 (C4) protein concentration based on:\n1. Direct encoding of the predominant circulating C4 protein variant\n2. Higher quantitative contribution to plasma C4 levels\n3. Established genetic associations with C4 concentration phenotypes\n4. Biological mechanism directly linking gene function to the measured phenotype\n\n---\n\n### References\n[1] Biological mechanism: C4A encodes the alpha variant, which is the major circulating form of complement component 4\n[2] Quantitative evidence: C4A typically produces more circulating C4 protein than C4B\n[3] GWAS evidence: C4A variants show stronger associations with circulating C4 concentration phenotypes",
