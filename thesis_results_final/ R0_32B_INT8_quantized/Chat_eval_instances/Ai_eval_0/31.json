Direct association with HDL cholesterol measurement phenotype\n2. Statistical significance (p-values)\n3. Effect size magnitude\n4. Biological relevance of mapped genes\n\n## Key Findings\n\n### Primary Candidate: rs2366858\n**Primary associations:**\n- HDL cholesterol: p = 6×10⁻¹⁰, β = 0.0325\n- High density lipoprotein cholesterol levels: p = 1×10⁻⁸, β = 1.398273\n\n**Gene context:** CD36 - SEMA3C locus, which plays a role in lipid metabolism and cholesterol regulation\n\n**Study source:** Genome-wide characterization of shared and distinct genetic components that influence blood lipid levels in ethnically diverse human populations\n\n### Secondary Candidate: rs56113850\n**Associations with related phenotype:**\n- Non-HDL cholesterol levels: p = 2×10⁻¹⁴, β = 0.014895\n- Non-HDL cholesterol levels: p = 2×10⁻¹³, β = 0.01345\n\n**Gene context:** CYP2A6, a cytochrome P450 enzyme involved in lipid metabolism\n\n### Other Variants\nThe remaining 9 variants (rs1471633, rs2229738, rs4788815, rs8012, rs1776029, rs2235544, rs9844948, rs2769264, rs560887) showed no associations with HDL cholesterol measurement phenotypes in the GWAS catalog data.\n\n## Analysis and Justification\n\nWhile rs56113850 demonstrated the most statistically significant associations (p = 2×10⁻¹⁴), it was associated with non-HDL cholesterol levels rather than the exact phenotype requested. The task specifically required prioritization for HDL cholesterol measurement, making direct phenotype matching the most critical criterion.\n\nrs2366858 is the optimal choice because it:\n- Shows direct associations with the exact requested phenotype\n- Has strong statistical significance (p-values of 6×10⁻¹⁰ and 1×10⁻⁸)\n- Demonstrates substantial effect sizes (β = 0.0325 and β = 1.398273)\n- Maps to genes (CD36-SEMA3C) with established roles in lipid metabolism\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**rs2366858** is the most promising variant for further examination in HDL cholesterol measurement studies, based on its direct phenotypic associations, strong statistical evidence, and biologically relevant gene context.",
