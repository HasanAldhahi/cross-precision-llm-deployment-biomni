This provides strong biological plausibility for the observed association.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**rs1532085** is the most promising variant for HDL cholesterol measurement based on:\n1. **Statistical Significance**: P-value of 1.0 × 10⁻²¹³ represents genome-wide significance with extremely high confidence\n2. **Phenotype Match**: Direct association with \"HDL cholesterol levels\" matches the requested phenotype exactly\n3. **Biological Relevance**: Located near the LIPC gene, which is functionally relevant to HDL cholesterol metabolism\n4. **Robust Validation**: Replicated across multiple ancestry populations (East Asian and European)\n\n## Recommendation\n\n**rs1532085** should be prioritized for further examination as it represents the strongest statistically and biologically validated association with HDL cholesterol measurement among the candidate variants.",
