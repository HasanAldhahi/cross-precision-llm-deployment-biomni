Let me provide the final answer.</think> Based on my systematic analysis of the patient's phenotypes and candidate genes, I can now provide the solution. **Plan:** 1. [✓] Convert Ensembl gene IDs to gene symbols and get gene information 2. [✓] Look up the meaning of each HP (Human Phenotype Ontology) term 3. [✓] Query gene-disease/phenotype associations from available databases 4. [✓] Match patient phenotypes with known gene associations 5. [✓] Identify the gene with the strongest association to the patient's phenotypes The patient has a constellation of neurological phenotypes including: - Aplasia/Hypoplasia of cerebellum (HP:0007360) - Aplasia/Hypoplasia of corpus callosum (HP:0007370) - Dandy-Walker malformation (HP:0001305) - Cerebral calcification (HP:0002514) - Abnormal cerebral ventricle morphology (HP:0002118) - Abnormality of central nervous system electrophysiology (HP:0030178) From the OMIM database, I found that: - **PCLO (ENSG00000186472)** is associated with \"Pontocerebellar hypoplasia, type 3\" - **FKTN (ENSG00000106692)** is associated with \"Muscular dystrophy-dystroglycanopathy (congenital with brain and eye anomalies)\" PCLO shows the strongest association with the patient's core neurological phenotypes, particularly cerebellar hypoplasia and brain malformations. Pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 3 is characterized by cerebellar malformations and brainstem abnormalities, which directly matches several of the patient's key phenotypes. <solution> {'causal_gene': ['ENSG00000186472']} </solution>",
