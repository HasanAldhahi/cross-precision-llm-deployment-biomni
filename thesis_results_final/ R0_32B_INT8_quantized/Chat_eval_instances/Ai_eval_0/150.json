[✓] Match the patient's HP terms with known gene-phenotype associations 4. [✓] Score and rank genes based on phenotype match 5. [✓] Identify the most likely causal gene **Analysis Summary:** The patient presents with a specific pattern of phenotypes that includes: - **Vascular abnormalities**: Cerebral berry aneurysm, aortic dissection, intracranial hemorrhage, aortic root aneurysm, interrupted aortic arch - **Neurological symptoms**: Seizures, visual field defects, hemiparesis, abnormal brainstem morphology, oculomotor nerve palsy - **Cardiovascular symptoms**: Increased blood pressure, cardiomegaly - **Muscle involvement**: Rhabdomyolysis From the DisGeNET database analysis, **COL4A1 (ENSG00000187498)** shows the strongest association with this phenotype pattern, being linked to 18 relevant vascular/neurological disorders including: - Aortic aneurysm, thoracic - Brain aneurysm - Cerebral aneurysm - Cerebral arterial aneurysm - Cerebral hemorrhage - Cerebrovascular disorders - Hemiparesis - Intracranial aneurysm COL4A1 mutations cause Alport syndrome, which is characterized by this exact combination of vascular and neurological manifestations due to basement membrane collagen abnormalities. While other candidate genes like FLNA and PAH showed some relevant associations, COL4A1 has the most comprehensive match with the patient's specific phenotype constellation. <solution> {'causal_gene': ['ENSG00000187498']} </solution>",
