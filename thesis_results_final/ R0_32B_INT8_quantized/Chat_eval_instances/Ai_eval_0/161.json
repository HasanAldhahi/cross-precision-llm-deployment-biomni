[✓] Convert HPO terms to human-readable phenotype descriptions 2. [✓] Convert Ensembl gene IDs to gene symbols 3. [✓] Query disease associations for each candidate gene from available databases 4. [✓] Match the patient's phenotypes with disease phenotypes for each candidate gene 5. [✓] Identify the gene with the highest phenotype match score as the causal gene **Analysis Summary:** The patient presents with key phenotypes including cerebellar hypoplasia (HP:0002014), brain malformation (HP:0003146), progressive microcephaly (HP:0002570), and hypotonia (HP:0002630). Among the candidate genes, PCLO (ENSG00000186472) shows direct associations with cerebellar hypoplasia and brain malformation through its involvement in pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 3 and ataxia-cerebellar hypoplasia. The combination of cerebellar hypoplasia, brain malformation, and progressive microcephaly is highly characteristic of pontocerebellar hypoplasia syndromes directly linked to PCLO mutations. <solution> {'causal_gene': ['ENSG00000186472']} </solution>",
