[✓] Convert Ensembl gene IDs to gene symbols and get gene information 3. [✓] Query disease databases (OMIM, DisGeNET) for disease associations with candidate genes 4. [✓] Match the patient's phenotypes with diseases associated with each candidate gene 5. [✓] Identify the most likely causal gene based on phenotype-disease-gene associations **Analysis Summary:** The patient presents with a complex constellation of vascular and neurological phenotypes including: - Cerebral berry aneurysm - Visual field defect - Seizures - Hemiparesis - Abnormal brainstem morphology - Aortic dissection - Intracranial hemorrhage - Cardiomegaly - Rhabdomyolysis - Aortic root aneurysm - Oculomotor nerve palsy - Interrupted aortic arch Among all 13 candidate genes, **COL4A1 (ENSG00000133703)** is the only gene that shows strong associations with this specific pattern of vascular and neurological abnormalities. COL4A1 is associated with: - Brain aneurysm - Cerebral arterial aneurysm - Intracranial aneurysm - Visual field defects - Seizures This gene encodes collagen IV alpha 1 chain, and mutations in COL4A1 are known to cause hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) and other vascular disorders that match the patient's phenotype pattern. <solution> {\"causal_gene\": [\"ENSG00000133703\"]} </solution>",
