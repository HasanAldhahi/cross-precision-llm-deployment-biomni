The analysis involved:\n\n1. Querying GWAS Catalog for triglyceride-related studies and associations\n2. Loading comprehensive GWAS catalog data from the biological data lake\n3. Filtering for the specific candidate variants\n4. Ranking variants by statistical significance and effect size\n5. Prioritizing based on direct associations with triglyceride measurement\n\n## Key Findings\n\n### Primary Result\n**rs4921914** emerged as the most promising variant for triglyceride measurement, showing:\n\n- **Direct associations** with triglyceride levels in 2 independent studies\n- **Highly significant p-values**: 2×10⁻²⁰ and 7×10⁻⁸\n- **Consistent effect across populations**: East Asian and trans-ancestry European studies\n- **Effect size**: 0.0353 (β-coefficient)\n\n### Secondary Findings\nOther variants in the list showed associations with related lipid metabolism traits but not specifically triglyceride measurement:\n\n- **rs3780181**: Multiple associations with LDL cholesterol, total cholesterol, and non-HDL cholesterol levels\n- **Other variants**: No significant associations found with triglyceride or related metabolic traits\n\n## Evidence Summary\n\n**rs4921914** demonstrates the strongest evidence for association with triglyceride measurement:\n- Most significant p-value: 2×10⁻²⁰ [1]\n- Replication in multi-ancestry studies: 7×10⁻⁸ [2]\n- Consistent replication across different populations\n- Direct association with the target phenotype (triglyceride levels)\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**rs4921914** is the most promising variant for further examination based on its direct, highly significant associations with triglyceride measurement in multiple independent studies.\n\n---\n\n**References:**\n[1] Association analyses of East Asian individuals and trans-ancestry analyses with European individuals reveal new loci associated with cholesterol and triglyceride levels\n[2] Multi-ancestry genome-wide gene-smoking interaction study of 387,272 individuals identifies new loci associated with serum lipids",
