I checked multiple databases (DisGeNET, GWAS Catalog, OMIM) for lymphoma associations\n2. IL2RA showed the strongest evidence:\n   - Found in 10 different lymphoma types in DisGeNET\n   - Direct GWAS association with \"marginal zone lymphoma or multiple sclerosis\" with P-value 3e-08\n   - Encodes the alpha chain (CD25) of the IL-2 receptor\n   - IL-2 is a key cytokine for T-cell activation and proliferation\n   - Biological mechanism clearly supports lymphoma pathogenesis\n\n3. Other genes showed limited evidence:\n   - IL15RA: Some lymphoma associations but less specific\n   - PRKCQ: T-cell lymphoma association but limited evidence  \n   - Others (ANKRD16, ASB13, FBH1, GDI2, PFKFB3, RBM17, TASOR2): No direct lymphoma associations found\n\nThe evidence clearly points to IL2RA as the likely causal gene for lymphoma in this locus. IL2RA has direct database associations with lymphoma, a significant GWAS association, and a strong biological mechanism - IL-2 signaling is fundamental to lymphocyte biology and lymphoma pathogenesis.\n\nI should provide the answer in the requested JSON format: {\"causal_gene\": \"IL2RA\"}</think>\n<solution>\n{\"causal_gene\": \"IL2RA\"}\n</solution>",
