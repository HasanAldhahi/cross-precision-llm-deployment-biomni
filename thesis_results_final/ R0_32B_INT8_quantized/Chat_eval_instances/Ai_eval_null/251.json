Key diagnostic features include:\n\n- Multiple distal joint contractures (camptodactyly of both fingers and toes)\n- Clubfoot deformity (talipes equinovarus)\n- Characteristic facial features (downslanted palpebral fissures)\n- Pattern of joint involvement consistent with distal arthrogryposis\n\n## Final Diagnosis\n\n**Disease Name**: Freeman-Sheldon syndrome  \n**OMIM ID**: 108120\n\nThis diagnosis is supported by the characteristic combination of distal joint contractures, clubfoot, and facial features in conjunction with mutations in the TPM2 gene, which encodes tropomyosin-2, a protein essential for muscle function and development.",
