This composite score reflects sex differences in traits like cholesterol levels, triglycerides, and other metabolic parameters.\n\n### Statistical Evidence\n\nFrom the GWAS catalog analysis, **CETP** showed the strongest association with the multi-trait sex score phenotype:\n- **P-value: 2e-31** (most significant association among all genes in the locus)\n- **Mapped gene: CETP** for the multi-trait sex score phenotype\n- Multiple additional associations found between CETP-related genes and sexual dimorphism in cardiometabolic traits\n\n### Biological Relevance\n\n**CETP (Cholesteryl Ester Transfer Protein)** encodes the cholesteryl ester transfer protein, which is directly involved in HDL cholesterol metabolism [2]. HDL cholesterol levels show strong sexual dimorphism, with women typically having higher HDL levels than men, making CETP highly relevant to sex differences in cardiometabolic traits.\n\n### Supporting Evidence\n\nLiterature searches revealed:\n- CETP has sex-specific effects on lipid metabolism, including testosterone-related differences [3]\n- Studies demonstrate sexually dimorphic effects of CETP variants on cholesterol transport and metabolic profiles\n- CETP variants affect HDL cholesterol levels, which are key components of cardiometabolic sexual dimorphism\n\n### Alternative Candidates\n\nWhile other genes in the locus showed some associations with sex-related traits, none had the direct association strength or biological relevance of CETP:\n- APOA5 showed estrogen-related regulation of triglycerides but weaker associations\n- Other genes (BANF1, CD248, etc.) showed minimal or no direct associations with multi-trait sex scores\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**CETP** is the most likely causal gene for the Multi-trait sex score phenotype based on:\n- Strongest statistical association (P-value: 2e-31)\n- Direct involvement in HDL cholesterol metabolism (which shows sexual dimorphism)\n- Literature evidence of sex-specific effects on cardiometabolic traits\n- Biological plausibility for controlling sexual dimorphism in metabolic phenotypes\n\n---\n\n*Analysis based on systematic review of 56 genes in the locus, GWAS catalog associations, and functional annotation data.*\n\n[1] UK Biobank study GCST90270116: Multi-trait sex score in cardiometabolic traits  \n[2] Cholesteryl ester transfer protein directly regulates HDL cholesterol levels  \n[3] Literature evidence shows CETP variants have sex-specific effects on lipid metabolism",
