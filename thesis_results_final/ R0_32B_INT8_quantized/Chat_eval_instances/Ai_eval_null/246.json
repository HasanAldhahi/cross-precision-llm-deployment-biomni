  "extracted_solution_or_last_step": "# Rare Disease Diagnosis Report\n\n## Patient Phenotype Analysis\n\nThe patient presents with multiple joint contractures primarily affecting the upper limbs and hands. Analysis of the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms reveals:\n\n**HPO Terms & Descriptions:**\n- HP:0009473: Joint contracture of the hand\n- HP:0001371: Flexion contracture (bent joint that cannot be straightened actively or passively)\n- HP:0000602: Abnormality of the hand\n- HP:0002650: Joint contracture (chronic loss of joint motion due to structural changes in muscle, tendons, ligaments, or skin)\n- HP:0000508: Joint contracture of the hand\n\nThese phenotypes collectively indicate a condition characterized by multiple, chronic joint contractures specifically affecting the hands and fingers, with flexion deformities preventing normal joint movement.\n\n## Genetic Analysis\n\n**Candidate Gene:** ENSG00000154864  \n**Gene Symbol:** PIEZO2  \n**Gene Name:** PIEZO-type mechanosensitive ion channel component 2  \n**Chromosomal Location:** Chromosome 18\n\n## Disease Association Analysis\n\nDatabase analysis revealed that PIEZO2 is associated with four primary conditions:\n\n1. **Arthrogryposis, distal, type 5** (OMIM: 108145) - Autosomal dominant\n2. **Arthrogryposis, distal, with impaired proprioception and touch** (OMIM: 617146) - Autosomal recessive\n3. **Arthrogryposis, distal, type 3** (OMIM: 114300) - Autosomal dominant\n4. **Marden-Walker syndrome** (OMIM: 248700) - Autosomal dominant\n\n## Clinical Correlation and Diagnosis\n\nGiven the patient's phenotype pattern of **multiple distal joint contractures specifically affecting the hands and fingers**, and the genetic evidence pointing to PIEZO2 mutations, the most likely diagnosis is:\n\n**Arthrogryposis, distal, type 5** (OMIM: 108145)\n\n### Diagnostic Rationale:\n- The patient's phenotypes are predominantly distal joint contractures affecting the hands\n- PIEZO2 mutations are well-established causes of distal arthrogryposis conditions\n- Among the PIEZO2-associated diseases, distal arthrogryposis type 5 specifically characterizes conditions with distal joint contractures affecting hands and feet\n- The phenotype pattern matches best with distal arthrogryposis rather than other arthrogryposis subtypes that may involve proximal joints or have additional systemic features\n- No evidence of proprioception/touch impairment or other features that would distinguish the other PIEZO2-associated conditions\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBased on comprehensive phenotype-genotype correlation analysis, the patient most likely has **Arthrogryposis, distal, type 5** caused by mutations in the PIEZO2 gene.\n\n**Diagnosis:**\n- Disease Name: Arthrogryposis, distal, type 5\n- OMIM ID: 108145",
