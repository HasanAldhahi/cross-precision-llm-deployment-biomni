Analysis of Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) codes to understand clinical symptoms\n2. Gene identification from Ensembl ID to determine candidate gene\n3. Cross-referencing with OMIM database to identify gene-associated diseases\n4. Phenotype-disease matching to determine the most likely diagnosis\n\n## Patient Phenotype Analysis\n\nThe patient presents with the following clinical features:\n\n| HPO Code | Description | Clinical Significance |\n|----------|-------------|----------------------|\n| HP:0001276 | Increased muscle tone so that arms or legs are stiff and difficult to move | Indicative of spasticity and muscle contractures |\n| HP:0001270 | Delay in acquiring motor skills | Suggestive of motor developmental delay |\n| HP:0002378 | Unintentional, oscillating to-and-fro muscle movement affecting the hand | Indicative of involuntary muscle movements |\n| HP:0000750 | Language development significantly below the norm for a child of a specified age | Evidence of speech/communication delay |\n| HP:0001263 | Delay in achievement of motor or mental milestones in children younger than five years | General developmental delay across multiple domains |\n\n## Gene Analysis\n\n**Candidate Gene**: ENSG00000158290 → **MYH3** (Myosin, heavy polypeptide-3, skeletal muscle, embryonic)\n\n## Disease Association Analysis\n\nMYH3 is associated with several related conditions according to OMIM database:\n\n1. **Freeman-Sheldon syndrome** (OMIM: 193700) - Autosomal dominant\n2. **Sheldon-Hall syndrome** (OMIM: 618436) - Autosomal dominant  \n3. Contractures, pterygia, and spondylocarpostarsal fusion syndromes\n\n## Diagnosis Justification\n\nThe constellation of patient phenotypes strongly supports **Freeman-Sheldon syndrome** as the most likely diagnosis:\n\n- **Muscle stiffness and contractures** (HP:0001276) - Core feature of Freeman-Sheldon syndrome\n- **Motor developmental delays** (HP:0001270, HP:0001263) - Characteristic of this condition\n- **Involuntary hand movements** (HP:0002378) - Consistent with muscle contractures and movement disorders seen in Freeman-Sheldon syndrome\n- **Language delays** (HP:0000750) - Part of the broader developmental delay phenotype\n\nFreeman-Sheldon syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant condition characterized by distal arthrogryposis, facial contractures, and developmental delays, which closely matches the patient's phenotypic profile.\n\n## Final Diagnosis\n\n**Disease Name**: Freeman-Sheldon syndrome  \n**OMIM ID**: 193700\n\n---\n\nThis diagnosis is supported by the strong phenotypic overlap between the patient's clinical presentation and the known manifestations of Freeman-Sheldon syndrome associated with MYH3 mutations.",
