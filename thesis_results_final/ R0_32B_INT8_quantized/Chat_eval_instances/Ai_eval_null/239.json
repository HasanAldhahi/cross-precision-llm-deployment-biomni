Direct mechanistic studies in T-cell lymphoma\n2. Established therapeutic targeting in lymphoma treatments\n3. Clear biological function in T-cell activation and survival\n4. Multiple independent research validations\n\nThe gene's central role in IL-2 signaling provides a robust biological rationale for its involvement in T-cell lymphoma pathogenesis, with extensive literature supporting its causal relationship to the disease.",
