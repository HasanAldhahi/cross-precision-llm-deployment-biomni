While the exact phenotype name did not return specific results from GWAS Catalog searches, the literature consistently demonstrates sex-specific effects in lipid metabolism-related traits, which likely form the basis of this multi-trait score.\n\n## Gene Analysis Results\n\n### Metabolic Genes (APO Family)\n- **APOA1, APOA4, APOA5, APOC3**: These apolipoprotein genes are all involved in lipid metabolism and HDL cholesterol regulation\n- **Key finding**: Literature demonstrates that \"sex hormones drive changes in lipoprotein metabolism\" and shows interactions between APO gene haplotypes and sex-related metabolic differences\n\n### Kinase and Signaling Genes\n- **SIK3**: Salt-inducible kinase 3 - positive regulator of mTOR signaling pathway\n- **Key finding**: mTOR pathway exhibits sexual dimorphism, and SIK3 regulates metabolic processes through mTOR signaling\n\n### Structural and Regulatory Genes\n- **TAGLN**: Transgelin - involved in actin binding and muscle function\n- **BUD13**: Involved in mRNA splicing and spliceosome assembly\n- **PAFAH1B2, SIDT2, ZPR1**: Involved in various cellular processes but less directly related to sexual dimorphism\n\n## Key Evidence for CETP\n\n1. **Direct Sex-Specific Effects**: Literature search revealed a study specifically titled \"Sex-Specific Effects of Cholesteryl Ester Transfer Protein (CETP) on the Perivascular Adipose Tissue\" (PMID: 38984977)\n\n2. **Lipid Metabolism Role**: CETP is central to lipid metabolism and lipoprotein regulation, which shows well-documented sexual dimorphism\n\n3. **Functional Mechanism**: CETP regulates triglyceride metabolism and has documented sex-specific effects on metabolic processes, particularly involving HDL cholesterol and adipose tissue\n\n4. **Biological Plausibility**: The multi-trait sex score likely captures sexual dimorphism across metabolic traits, and CETP's central role in lipid metabolism makes it highly biologically relevant\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**CETP** is identified as the most likely causal gene for the Multi-trait sex score GWAS phenotype based on its documented sex-specific effects on metabolic processes, central role in lipid metabolism, and biological plausibility in explaining sexual dimorphism across multiple metabolic traits.\n\n## References\n\n- Sex-Specific Effects of Cholesteryl Ester Transfer Protein (CETP) on the Perivascular Adipose Tissue (PMID: 38984977)\n- Interactions between apolipoprotein a1/c3/a5 haplotypes and alcohol consumption on serum lipid levels (PMID: 22924697)\n- Sex hormones drive changes in lipoprotein metabolism (iScience, PMID: 34761181)\n- Sexual dimorphism in response to intermittent fasting and its impact on the brain (Scientific Reports, PMID: 40640397)",
