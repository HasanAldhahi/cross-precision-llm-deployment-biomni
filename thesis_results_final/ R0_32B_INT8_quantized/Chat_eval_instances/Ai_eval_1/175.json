Hepatic failure (HP:0001399) - liver failure ASS1 (Argininosuccinate synthetase 1) is the enzyme responsible for citrulline metabolism in the urea cycle. When ASS1 is defective, it causes citrullinemia, which leads to: - Elevated citrulline levels in blood (HP:0011966) - Hyperammonemia (HP:0001987) due to impaired urea cycle - Hepatic failure (HP:0001399) as a complication of the metabolic disorder This is a clear match - the phenotypes are characteristic of ASS1 deficiency.</think> Looking at the phenotype and gene analysis, I can see a clear pattern. The key phenotypes are: - HP:0001987: Hyperammonemia (increased concentration of ammonia in the blood) - HP:0011966: Elevated plasma citrulline (increased concentration of citrulline in the blood) - HP:0001399: Hepatic failure From the OMIM data, ASS1 (ENSG00000130707) is associated with \"Citrullinemia, 215700 (3), Autosomal recessive\". ASS1 encodes argininosuccinate synthetase 1, which is a key enzyme in the urea cycle that processes citrulline. The combination of hyperammonemia, elevated plasma citrulline, and hepatic failure is highly characteristic of citrullinemia caused by ASS1 deficiency. The other candidate genes are associated with different conditions (Robinow syndrome, Bardet-Biedl syndrome, cardiomyopathy, etc.) that don't match this specific phenotype constellation. <solution> {'causal_gene': ['ENSG00000130707']} </solution>",
