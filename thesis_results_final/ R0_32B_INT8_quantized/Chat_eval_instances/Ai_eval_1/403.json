Direct associations with anterior amygdaloid area volume\n2. Statistical significance of associations\n3. Consistency across multiple studies and brain subregions\n4. Biological plausibility based on gene function\n\n## Key Findings\n\n### SLC39A8 (Primary Candidate)\n- **Direct associations**: 17 independent studies specifically linking to anterior amygdaloid area volume\n- **Statistical significance**: P-values ranging from 1e-57 to 8e-44, representing extremely significant associations\n- **Subregion specificity**: Consistent associations across multiple amygdala subregions including:\n  - Central nucleus (P-value: 2e-53)\n  - Medial nucleus (P-value: 1e-57) \n  - Cortical nucleus (P-value: 2e-39)\n  - Accessory basal nucleus (P-value: 2e-15)\n- **Biological mechanism**: Functions as a zinc transporter critical for brain development and neurological function\n- **Additional brain associations**: 4 brain morphology studies with P-values up to 3e-124\n\n### Secondary Candidates\n\n**BANK1** showed some relevant associations but with key limitations:\n- 9 studies related to amygdala volume with P-values ranging from 2e-09 to 2e-18\n- Often co-occurred with SLC39A8 in the same studies\n- Less consistent across different amygdala subregions\n\n**NFKB1** showed limited brain-specific associations:\n- 2 studies related to anterior amygdaloid area volume with P-values of 7e-10 and 1e-20\n- Primarily involved in immune/inflammatory processes rather than structural brain phenotypes\n\n### Other Candidates\n- **CISD2**: Limited brain-related associations, primarily neurological syndromes\n- **MANBA**: Associated with lysosomal storage diseases, no brain volume associations\n- **SLC9B1**: Minimal brain-related associations found\n- **UBE2D3**: No direct associations with brain volume phenotypes identified\n\n## Biological Rationale\n\nSLC39A8 encodes a zinc transporter that plays a crucial role in brain development and structure formation. Zinc is essential for:\n- Neurodevelopment and synaptic plasticity\n- Brain region volume regulation\n- Amygdala function and emotional processing\n- Structural brain connectivity\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**SLC39A8** is the most likely causal gene for anterior amygdaloid area volume based on:\n\n1. Superior statistical evidence (most significant and numerous associations)\n2. Consistent replication across multiple studies and brain subregions\n3. Strong biological plausibility as a zinc transporter in brain development\n4. Specific functional relevance to neurological and brain structural phenotypes\n\nThis gene represents a promising target for further investigation into the genetic mechanisms underlying brain structure development and potential neurological disorders affecting the amygdala.",
