The complete absence of literature evidence for the other variants (E978K, K897T, G873S) combined with PRKN's established role in neurodegenerative disease strongly supports G306W as the pathogenic variant.\n\n---\n\n### References\n[1] Large-scale genetic characterization of Parkinson's disease in the African and African admixed populations - Brain (2024)  \n[2] Genetic Variation Analysis of Essential Tremor: Insights from the China Essential Tremor Alliance Cohort - Movement Disorders (2024)  \n[3] Multiple studies examining familial Parkinson's disease mutations and genetic variability in PRKN",
