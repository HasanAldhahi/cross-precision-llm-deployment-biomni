This variant shows a direct association with bradykinin, des-arg 9 levels with an extremely significant p-value of 4×10⁻⁴⁸.\n\n## Methodology\n\n1. **Data Source**: GWAS Catalog database accessed via the biological data lake (622,784 associations across 34 data fields)\n2. **Search Strategy**: Systematic screening of all 11 target variants for bradykinin-related associations\n3. **Phenotype Mapping**: Identified bradykinin-related traits including \"x-12038-to-bradykinin, des-arg 9 ratio\" and \"bradykinin, des-arg 9 levels\"\n4. **Statistical Prioritization**: Ranked variants by p-value significance and direct phenotype relevance\n\n## Key Findings\n\n### Primary Association\n- **Variant**: rs4253311\n- **Phenotype**: bradykinin, des-arg 9 levels\n- **P-value**: 4×10⁻⁴⁸ (extremely significant)\n- **Effect Size (Beta)**: 0.141\n- **Study**: \"An atlas of genetic influences on human blood metabolites\"\n- **Genomic Context**: Located in a region affecting circulating kininogen metabolites\n\n### Other Variants\nThe remaining 10 variants (rs7700133, rs1280, rs7651090, rs3738934, rs7385804, rs1367117, rs4808136, rs10087900, rs855791, rs12678919) showed **no direct associations** with bradykinin or bradykinin-related phenotypes in the GWAS Catalog database.\n\n## Biological Significance\n\nBradykinin is a key peptide in the kallikrein-kinin system, which plays crucial roles in:\n- Blood pressure regulation\n- Cardiovascular function\n- Inflammatory responses\n- Vascular homeostasis\n\nThe des-arg 9 bradykinin form is an active metabolite of bradykinin, making this association particularly relevant for understanding bradykinin biology and potential therapeutic interventions.\n\n## Recommendation\n\n**rs4253311** is recommended as the top priority variant for further examination based on:\n1. Direct association with bradykinin metabolism\n2. Genome-wide significant statistical evidence\n3. Potential functional relevance to cardiovascular and metabolic pathways\n\n## Supporting Evidence\n\nThe association was identified in a comprehensive metabolomics study examining genetic influences on human blood metabolites, providing robust evidence for the variant's role in bradykinin regulation [1].\n\n---\n\n**References:**\n[1] Study: \"An atlas of genetic influences on human blood metabolites\" - GWAS Catalog entry demonstrating rs4253311 association with bradykinin, des-arg 9 levels (P = 4×10⁻⁴⁸)",
