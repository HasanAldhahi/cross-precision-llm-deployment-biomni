The analysis included:\n\n1. Literature search via PubMed for NSCLC associations\n2. GWAS catalog analysis for lung cancer associations  \n3. Functional annotation review for cancer relevance\n4. DisGeNET and OMIM database analysis for gene-disease associations\n\n## Key Findings\n\n### FLT1 (FMS-Like Tyrosine Kinase 1/VEGFR1) - Primary Candidate\n\n**Strong Evidence:**\n- Multiple direct literature sources linking FLT1 to non-small cell lung cancer [1][2][3]\n- VEGFR1 expression is associated with squamous cell carcinoma subtype in NSCLC [4]\n- Critical role in lung cancer angiogenesis and metastasis [5]\n- VEGF signaling pathway (mediated by FLT1) represents a key therapeutic target in NSCLC [6]\n- Direct diagnostic relevance: circulating antibodies against VEGFR1 used for NSCLC detection [7]\n\n### Secondary Candidates\n\n**MTUS2 (Microtubule-Associated Tumor Suppressor 2):**\n- Identified in NSCLC fusion gene scenarios (ALK-MTUS2) [8]\n- Functions as tumor suppressor in hepatocellular and gastric cancers [9]\n- Limited evidence for primary causality in NSCLC\n\n**CDX2 (CAUDAL Type Homeobox 2):**\n- Found in lung adenocarcinoma progression studies [10]\n- Functions as transcription factor in development\n- No direct causality evidence for NSCLC\n\n### Other Candidates\n\n**FLT3 (FMS-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3):** Related to RET-altered cancers, not specifically lung cancer\n\n**PAN3, PDX1, POMP, SLC46A3, URAD:** No direct lung cancer associations identified\n\n## Biological Rationale\n\nFLT1 encodes VEGFR1 (Flt-1), a receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a central role in:\n\n- **Angiogenesis**: Critical for tumor growth and metastasis\n- **VEGF signaling**: A key pathway in NSCLC progression and therapeutic targeting\n- **Tumor-stroma interactions**: Mediates communication between cancer cells and blood vessels\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**FLT1** demonstrates the strongest evidence for being the causal gene in this locus for Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma, supported by multiple independent lines of evidence including direct literature associations, functional relevance, and therapeutic significance.\n\n---\n\n**References:**\n[1] FLT1 expression associated with NSCLC subtypes and diagnostic markers  \n[2] VEGFR1 expression linked to squamous cell carcinoma subtype in NSCLC  \n[3] FLT1-enriched extracellular vesicles promote cancer angiogenesis and metastasis  \n[4] VEGF signaling mediates treatment response in NSCLC patients  \n[5] PIGF and Flt-1 promote lung cancer angiogenesis via tumor-associated macrophages  \n[6] VEGFR1 targeted therapies for advanced NSCLC treatment  \n[7] Circulating VEGFR1 antibodies as NSCLC diagnostic biomarkers  \n[8] ALK-MTUS2 fusion gene identified in lung adenocarcinoma patients  \n[9] MTUS2 regulates cancer growth and metastasis through tumor suppressor pathways  \n[10] CDX2-CBX3 regulatory axis involved in lung adenocarcinoma progression",
