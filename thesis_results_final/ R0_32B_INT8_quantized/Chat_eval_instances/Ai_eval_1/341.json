Systematic evaluation of gene functions from the provided locus\n2. Assessment of biological relevance to diabetes pathogenesis\n3. Literature-based validation of gene-disease associations\n4. Prioritization based on mechanistic connection to glucose homeostasis\n\n## Gene Analysis Results\n\n### Primary Candidates\n\n**HNF1A (Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 1 Alpha)**\n- Function: Transcription factor expressed specifically in pancreatic beta cells\n- Role in diabetes: Directly regulates insulin production and glucose metabolism\n- Evidence: Mutations cause MODY (Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young), a monogenic diabetes form\n- Biological plausibility: Highest - master regulator of pancreatic function\n\n**ACADS (Acyl-CoA Dehydrogenase, Short-Chain)**\n- Function: Involved in fatty acid metabolism\n- Role in diabetes: Could affect insulin sensitivity through metabolic syndrome pathways\n- Biological plausibility: Moderate - indirect connection to glucose metabolism\n\n**CAMKK2 (Calcium/Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase Kinase 2)**\n- Function: Involved in calcium signaling\n- Role in diabetes: Connections to metabolic processes and insulin signaling\n- Biological plausibility: Moderate - role in insulin secretion\n\n**P2RX4/P2RX7 (P2X Purinoceptors)**\n- Function: Purinergic receptors involved in cellular communication\n- Role in diabetes: Links to metabolic dysfunction and inflammatory processes\n- Biological plausibility: Low to moderate - indirect mechanisms\n\n### Secondary Candidates\n\n**CABP1**: Calcium binding protein - involved in calcium signaling pathways\n**COQ5**: Coenzyme Q5 - mitochondrial function and oxidative metabolism\n**Other genes**: Various functions in protein regulation, cellular structure, and RNA processing with minimal direct diabetes relevance\n\n## Key Findings\n\nHNF1A demonstrates the strongest biological connection to Type 2 diabetes pathogenesis through several key mechanisms:\n\n1. **Direct insulin regulation**: As a master transcription factor in pancreatic beta cells, HNF1A directly controls insulin gene expression\n2. **Monogenic diabetes causation**: HNF1A mutations are established causes of MODY, providing definitive evidence of its role in diabetes\n3. **Glucose homeostasis**: Central to maintaining normal glucose metabolism through pancreatic function\n4. **GWAS relevance**: The gene's function aligns perfectly with diabetes pathogenesis independent of BMI effects\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**HNF1A** is the most likely causal gene within this locus for Type 2 diabetes (adjusted for BMI) based on its direct mechanistic role in insulin production, established connection to monogenic diabetes forms, and central position in glucose homeostasis regulation.\n\n## Final Answer\n\n# HNF1A",
