Strong functional role in cholesterol homeostasis\n2. Direct clinical associations with familial hypercholesterolemia\n3. Extensive literature documentation in lipid metabolism research\n4. Established therapeutic relevance in cholesterol disorders\n5. Multiple independent studies confirming its central role\n\nThe evidence strongly supports PCSK9 as the causal gene for Disorders of lipoid metabolism in this locus, with significantly greater support than alternative candidates.\n\n**Final Answer: PCSK9**",
