The analysis included:\n- Literature search for diabetes-related associations\n- GWAS database queries for Type 2 diabetes associations\n- Statistical evaluation of association strengths\n- Functional annotation review\n\n## Key Findings\n\n### GLIS3: Strong Evidence for Causality\n\n**Statistical Evidence:**\n- 19 total diabetes-related studies mentioning GLIS3\n- 15 specifically related to **Type 2 diabetes** with highly significant p-values\n- Most significant association: **p-value = 4e-27** (East Asian population study)\n- Additional strong associations: p-values ranging from 2e-14 to 6e-12 across multiple populations\n\n**Study Examples:**\n- Identification of type 2 diabetes loci in 433,540 East Asian individuals (p=4e-27)\n- Genome-wide association analyses identify 143 risk variants for Type 2 diabetes (p=3e-15)\n- Meta-analysis of GWAS identifies new loci in East Asians (p=2e-14)\n\n**Biological Plausibility:**\nGLIS3 encodes a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in pancreatic beta cell function and insulin secretion, providing strong biological rationale for its involvement in Type 2 diabetes pathogenesis.\n\n### Other Candidate Genes: Limited Evidence\n\n- **AK3, CDC37L1, PLPP6, SLC1A1, SPATA6L**: No direct associations with Type 2 diabetes found in the GWAS catalog\n- These genes showed no consistent diabetes-related associations across multiple studies and populations\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**GLIS3** demonstrates the strongest evidence for causality in Type 2 diabetes susceptibility based on:\n- Consistent replication across multiple independent studies\n- Extremely significant statistical associations (p-values reaching 4e-27)\n- Biological relevance to diabetes pathophysiology\n- Cross-population validation in East Asian, Japanese, and Chinese cohorts\n\nThe absence of diabetes associations for the other candidate genes, combined with GLIS3's robust statistical and biological evidence, supports its identification as the likely causal gene in this locus.\n\n---\n\n*Analysis based on GWAS catalog data containing 895,000 diabetes-related studies and 638,000 Type 2 diabetes-specific studies.*",
