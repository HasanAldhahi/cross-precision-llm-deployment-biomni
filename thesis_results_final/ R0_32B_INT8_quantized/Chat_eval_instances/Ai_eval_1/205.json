Direct involvement in complement system function\n2. Established connection to PNH pathogenesis\n3. Specific mention in therapeutic contexts for this condition\n4. Biological plausibility through complement-mediated hemolysis mechanisms\n\n---\n\n### References\n[1] \"Challenges in optimizing targeted complement inhibitor therapy for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria\"\n[2] \"Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria: Unraveling Its Molecular Pathogenesis and Advancing Targeted Therapeutic Strategies\"  \n[3] \"Pharmacological Therapies in Paroxysmal Nocturnal Haemoglobinuria: Focus on Complement Inhibition\"",
