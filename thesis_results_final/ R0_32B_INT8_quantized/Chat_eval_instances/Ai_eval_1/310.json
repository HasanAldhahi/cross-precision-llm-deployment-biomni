The gene set represents genes down-regulated in MCF10A breast cancer cells upon BRCA1 knockdown by RNAi.\n\n## Methods\n1. Accessed MSigDB C6 oncogenic signature gene set data from the biological data lake\n2. Located the specific gene set BRCA1_DN.V1_DN within the dataset\n3. Cross-referenced provided options against the complete gene list\n\n## Key Findings\n\n### Gene Set Composition\n- **Total genes**: 1,313 genes\n- **Collection**: MSigDB C6 (oncogenic signature gene sets)\n- **Systematic name**: M2747\n- **Gene set ID**: BRCA1_DN.V1_DN\n\n### Option Analysis\nWhen comparing each provided option against the BRCA1_DN.V1_DN gene set:\n\n| Option | Gene Symbol | Present in Gene Set | Status |\n|--------|-------------|-------------------|---------|\n| A | PPP1R15B | ❌ | Not present |\n| B | PLEC | ❌ | Not present |\n| **C** | **SPATA31A1** | **✅** | **Present** |\n| D | Insufficient information | N/A | Not applicable |\n| E | SSX3 | ❌ | Not present |\n\n## Conclusion\n**Answer: C. SPATA31A1**\n\nSPATA31A1 is the only gene among the provided options that is definitively contained within the BRCA1_DN.V1_DN gene set. This finding is based on direct verification against the complete MSigDB C6 dataset, confirming that SPATA31A1 is down-regulated in MCF10A breast cancer cells upon BRCA1 knockdown.",
