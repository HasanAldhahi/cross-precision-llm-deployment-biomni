PubMed literature search for diabetes associations\n2. GWAS catalog interrogation for statistical evidence\n3. OMIM database analysis for known genetic disorders\n\n## Key Findings\n\n### GWAS Evidence\nPPARG demonstrated the strongest statistical associations with Type 2 diabetes:\n- **57 independent GWAS associations** with Type 2 diabetes\n- P-values ranging from **2×10⁻⁵³ to 1×10⁻⁷** (extremely significant)\n- Additional associations with related metabolic traits (fasting insulin, insulin sensitivity, BMI interactions)\n\n### OMIM Database Analysis\nPPARG showed direct clinical evidence for diabetes-related phenotypes:\n- **Type 2 diabetes** (OMIM #125853)\n- **Severe insulin resistance** (OMIM #604367) \n- **Familial partial lipodystrophy type 3** (OMIM #604367)\n- **Severe obesity** (OMIM #601665)\n\n### Literature Support\nPPARG has extensive scientific literature documenting its role in:\n- Glucose metabolism regulation\n- Insulin sensitivity mechanisms\n- Diabetes pathogenesis and treatment\n- Metabolic syndrome components\n\n### Comparative Analysis\nOther genes showed limited evidence:\n- **RPL32**: 11 associations, primarily with Type 1 diabetes\n- **SYN2**: 6 associations with Type 2 diabetes  \n- **TSEN2**: 4 associations with Type 2 diabetes\n- **CAND2**: 1 association with glucose levels\n- Remaining genes: Minimal or no direct diabetes associations\n\n## Biological Rationale\n\nPPARG encodes Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Gamma, a nuclear receptor that:\n- Regulates glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity\n- Controls adipogenesis and lipid metabolism\n- Is the target of thiazolidinedione diabetes medications\n- Has well-established mechanistic pathways in diabetes pathogenesis\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**PPARG** is the most likely causal gene for Type 2 diabetes in this locus, supported by:\n1. Strongest statistical evidence from GWAS studies\n2. Direct clinical phenotype associations in OMIM\n3. Extensive mechanistic literature\n4. Well-established biological role in glucose homeostasis\n\n---\n*Analysis conducted by systematic evaluation of multiple evidence sources, identifying PPARG as the gene with convergent evidence for Type 2 diabetes causality.*",
