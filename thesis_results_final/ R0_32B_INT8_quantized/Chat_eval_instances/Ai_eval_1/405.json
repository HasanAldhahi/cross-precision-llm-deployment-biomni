Direct Enzymatic Function\n- SULT1A1 encodes a sulfotransferase enzyme that directly catalyzes sulfation reactions [2]\n- Sulfotransferases are the key enzymes responsible for adding sulfate groups to metabolites\n- This represents a direct mechanistic relationship with the observed phenotype\n\n#### 2. Literature Evidence\n- Multiple studies demonstrate SULT1A1's role in sulfating xenobiotics and drugs [3]\n- Research shows SULT1A1 knockout vs wild-type mice have different sulfation capacities [4]\n- SULT1A1 has been specifically implicated in DNA adduct formation through sulfation processes [5]\n\n#### 3. Biological Plausibility\n- The metabolite \"propyl 4-hydroxybenzoate sulfate\" requires sulfation to form the sulfate derivative\n- SULT1A1 is the most well-characterized sulfotransferase for common xenobiotic compounds\n- SULT1A1 exhibits broader substrate specificity compared to SULT1A2 for similar compounds\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**SULT1A1** is the most likely causal gene for propyl 4-hydroxybenzoate sulfate metabolite levels based on its direct enzymatic function in sulfation pathways and extensive literature support for metabolite processing.\n\n---\n\n### References\n[1] Wastewater-based epidemiology studies on propyl paraben exposure and biomarkers  \n[2] UniProt functional annotation of SULT1A1 as sulfotransferase 1A1  \n[3] Studies identifying SULT1A1 involvement in drug and xenobiotic sulfation  \n[4] Comparative studies of SULT1A1 knockout vs wild-type mice in sulfation processes  \n[5] Research on SULT1A1-mediated DNA adduct formation through sulfation mechanisms",
