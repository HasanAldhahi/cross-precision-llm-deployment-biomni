This mechanism specifically targets the glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) enzyme, which is crucial for cellular defense against ferroptosis-induced oxidative damage [1].\n\n### Candidate Gene Analysis\nAmong the 11 candidate genes evaluated (TBC1D9, MARVELD2, CALCR, HOXB7, CRIPAK, SLC9A8, ENY2, COCH, ACSL4, CRIP2, RYR1), **ACSL4** demonstrated the strongest mechanistic connection to the ferroptosis pathway targeted by ML-210.\n\n### ACSL4-Ferroptosis Connection\nACSL4 showed direct involvement in ferroptosis through multiple lines of evidence:\n\n1. **Pathway Involvement**: ACSL4 is a key component of the **GPX4/ACSL4 signaling pathway** that regulates ferroptosis induction [2]\n2. **Cancer Relevance**: Multiple studies demonstrate ACSL4's role in cancer cell ferroptosis responses across different cancer types [3]\n3. **Mechanistic Studies**: Research shows ACSL4 regulation affects cell susceptibility to ferroptosis-inducing agents [4]\n\n### Comparative Analysis\nOther candidate genes showed limited or no direct connections to the GPX4/ACSL4 ferroptosis pathway:\n- CRIP2 showed cancer relevance but no direct ferroptosis connection\n- TBC1D9 showed some cancer connections but not to ferroptosis pathways\n- Remaining genes demonstrated minimal relevance to ferroptosis mechanisms\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**ACSL4** is recommended as the gene with the strongest perturbation effect because:\n\n1. **Direct Pathway Involvement**: ACSL4 is directly in the GPX4/ACSL4 signaling pathway targeted by ML-210\n2. **Mechanistic Relevance**: Perturbation of ACSL4 would directly impact ferroptosis regulation and cellular response to ML-210\n3. **Experimental Context Match**: The 8-day timecourse with ML-210 treatment creates optimal conditions for observing ACSL4 perturbation effects on ferroptosis susceptibility\n4. **Strong Literature Support**: Multiple recent studies confirm ACSL4's critical role in ferroptosis regulation\n\n---\n\n### References\n[1] ML-210 functions as a GPX4 degrader inducing ferroptosis in human cancer cells  \n[2] GPX4/ACSL4 signaling pathway regulates ferroptosis induction  \n[3] ACSL4 involvement in cancer cell ferroptosis responses across multiple cancer types  \n[4] ACSL4 regulation affects cellular susceptibility to ferroptosis-inducing agents",
