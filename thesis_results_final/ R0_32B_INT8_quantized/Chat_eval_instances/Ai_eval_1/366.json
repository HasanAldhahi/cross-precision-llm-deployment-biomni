Nonionizing radiation, particularly UV radiation, causes skin damage through oxidative stress and impacts skin pigmentation and melanin production.\n\n## Methodology\n\n1. **Literature Review**: Systematic search of PubMed for associations between candidate genes and radiation-induced skin changes\n2. **GWAS Analysis**: Comprehensive review of GWAS catalog data for skin-related associations\n3. **Functional Assessment**: Evaluation of each gene's biological function relevant to skin radiation response\n\n## Key Findings\n\n### MC1R - Primary Candidate\n**MC1R** emerged as the strongest candidate based on multiple lines of evidence:\n\n**Biological Function**: MC1R encodes the melanocortin 1 receptor, which directly controls melanin production in melanocytes [1]. This receptor regulates the type of melanin produced (eumelanin vs. pheomelanin), with eumelanin providing UV protection and pheomelanin offering less protection [2].\n\n**GWAS Evidence**: MC1R shows significant associations with multiple UV-related skin conditions:\n- Basal cell carcinoma (P-values: 3e-63, 2e-15)\n- Cutaneous melanoma (P-values: 3e-63, 2e-15)\n- Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (P-values: 2e-15)\n- Vitiligo (P-values: 3e-63)\n\n**Literature Support**: Multiple studies confirm MC1R's role in:\n- UVB-induced skin hyperpigmentation via antioxidant and anti-melanogenic mechanisms [3]\n- Skin photodamage and melanogenesis regulation [4]\n- Interactions between UV light and MC1R variants affecting nevus and freckle phenotypes [5]\n- Chronic melanocortin-1 receptor activation and skin response to UV radiation [6]\n\n### Secondary Candidates\n\n**FANCA**: Involved in DNA repair pathways through homologous recombination [7]. While important for radiation damage response, it provides general DNA repair rather than specific skin radiation protection.\n\n**SPATA33**: Associated with squamous cell carcinoma and cell adhesion functions, but less directly connected to UV radiation response.\n\n**Other Candidates**: Remaining genes primarily involved in transcription regulation, protein synthesis, or other cellular processes without direct skin radiation response mechanisms.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**MC1R is identified as the most likely causal gene** for skin changes due to chronic exposure to nonionizing radiation based on:\n\n1. **Direct mechanistic role** in melanin production - the skin's natural UV protection\n2. **Strong GWAS associations** with UV-related skin damage and cancer\n3. **Extensive literature support** for UV radiation response\n4. **Biological plausibility** matching the phenotype description\n\nThe phenotype \"skin changes due to chronic exposure to nonionizing radiation\" directly relates to MC1R's fundamental function in controlling skin pigmentation and UV protection mechanisms.\n\n---\n\n**References:**\n[1] Melanocortin 1 receptor mediates melanin production by interacting with the BBSome in primary cilia\n[2] Disrupting the MC1R/α-MSH-pCREB-MITF Axis: Rhein-based PROTAC D16 as a Potent Melanogenesis Inhibitor  \n[3] 3,7-dihydroxy-2,4-dimethoxyphenanthrene protects against UVB-induced skin hyperpigmentation\n[4] Assessment of the Influence of UVR in Cutaneous Melanoma\n[5] Interactions between ultraviolet light and MC1R and OCA2 variants affecting nevus phenotypes\n[6] An overview of benefits and risks of chronic melanocortin-1 receptor activation\n[7] Fanconi anemia protein FANCD2 promotes DNA repair through homologous recombination",
