The patient's clinical presentation is consistent with VCP-associated Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2Y and inclusion body myopathy with frontotemporal dementia, making VCP the most likely causal gene.\n\n---\n*Analysis conducted using OMIM database (v2025), DisGeNET database, and Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) database*",
