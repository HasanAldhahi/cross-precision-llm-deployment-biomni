Comprehensive evidence across literature, GWAS, and OMIM databases\n2. Strong statistical associations with breast cancer risk\n3. Well-established biological mechanism in breast cancer development\n4. Direct clinical relevance through estrogen receptor signaling\n\n---\n\n### References\n[1] Literature evidence includes studies on ESR1 fusion gene transcripts in primary breast cancer and hormone receptor-positive breast cancer progression  \n[2] GWAS Catalog associations include large-scale studies with p-values reaching genome-wide significance thresholds  \n[3] OMIM database confirms ESR1 as directly associated with breast cancer susceptibility  \n[4] Estrogen receptor signaling represents a fundamental mechanism in breast cancer biology, particularly for hormone-sensitive tumors",
