Mutations cause structural cardiac muscle defects leading to cardiomegaly, arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death [4]\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**Causal Gene**: ENSG00000173801 (JUP)\n\nThe analysis strongly supports JUP as the causal gene based on its direct association with conditions that produce the patient's specific cardiac phenotype constellation. This represents a comprehensive match where the gene's disease mechanisms directly explain the most specific and severe clinical features.\n\n---\n\n### References\n[1] OMIM database entry for JUP gene - Naxos disease and arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia associations  \n[2] Cardiac phenotype specificity analysis - cardiomegaly as hallmark of JUP-related cardiac muscle diseases  \n[3] Secondary symptom explanation - systemic effects through primary cardiac dysfunction  \n[4] Molecular mechanism - plakoglobin's role in cardiac desmosome structure and function",
