The patient's phenotype profile is characteristic of COL2A1-related disorders, particularly Stickler syndrome and platyspondylic skeletal dysplasia. This gene shows the most precise match with the patient's clinical presentation among all candidate genes analyzed.\n\n**Final Answer:** {'causal_gene': ['ENSG00000139219']}",
