This analysis evaluated 30 genes within the locus to identify the most biologically plausible causal gene.\n\n## Methodology\n\n1. **Phenotype characterization**: Searched literature for \"Multi-trait sex score\" and related sexual dimorphism phenotypes\n2. **Gene-specific analysis**: Queried GWAS catalog and literature for associations between candidate genes and sex-related traits\n3. **Biological evidence assessment**: Evaluated functional relevance of genes to sex differences and sexual dimorphism\n\n## Key Findings\n\n### CETP: Strong Evidence for Sex-Specific Effects\n\nMultiple lines of evidence support CETP as the causal gene:\n\n**Sex-Specific Effects on Metabolic Traits [1]**\n- \"Sex-Specific Effects of Cholesteryl Ester Transfer Protein (CETP) on the Perivascular Adipose Tissue\" (PMID: 38984977)\n- Demonstrates differential effects of CETP variants between males and females\n\n**Sexual Dimorphism in Cardiometabolic Health [2]**\n- \"Sexually dimorphic DNA-methylation in cardiometabolic health: A systematic review\" (PMID: 32252966)\n- Shows CETP involvement in sexually dimorphic cardiometabolic traits\n- Evidence of sex-specific epigenetic regulation affecting lipid metabolism\n\n**Gender-Specific Genetic Associations [3]**\n- \"Patterns of association between genetic variability in cholesterol ester transfer protein gene regions and quantitative variation in lipid and lipoprotein traits: influence of gender and exogenous hormones\" (PMID: 1346081)\n- Documents clear gender influence on CETP genetic associations\n- Shows consistent sex-specific effects across multiple lipid traits\n\n### Alternative Candidates\n\n**BBS2** showed some relevance through association with Bardet-Biedl syndrome, which can affect sexual development. However, evidence was limited to specific syndrome-related effects rather than general sexual dimorphism.\n\n**Metallothionein genes (MT1A, MT1B, etc.)** and **chemokine genes (CCL17, CCL22)** showed no clear associations with sex-related traits in the literature.\n\n## Biological Rationale\n\nCETP's role as a causal gene for multi-trait sex scores is biologically plausible due to:\n\n1. **Lipid metabolism involvement**: Multiple metabolic traits show sexual dimorphism\n2. **Cardiometabolic effects**: Cardiometabolic phenotypes are commonly used in multi-trait scores\n3. **Sex-specific expression patterns**: Established sexually dimorphic regulation\n4. **Multi-trait influence**: Affects multiple phenotypes simultaneously (cholesterol, HDL, lipid profiles)\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**CETP** is identified as the most likely causal gene for the Multi-trait sex score GWAS phenotype based on:\n- Consistent literature documenting sex-specific effects\n- Established sexual dimorphism in cardiometabolic traits\n- Multi-trait associations across lipid metabolism\n- Biological plausibility for affecting composite sex-related scores\n\n**Answer: CETP**\n\n---\n\n**References:**\n[1] Sex-specific effects on perivascular adipose tissue regulation  \n[2] Sexually dimorphic DNA methylation patterns in cardiometabolic health  \n[3] Gender-specific associations in lipid trait variability studies",
