Literature search for ovarian cancer/ovarian neoplasm associations\n2. GWAS Catalog database querying for relevant associations  \n3. Functional annotation based on known biological pathways\n4. Assessment of established cancer relevance\n\n## Key Findings\n\n### Primary Candidate: FOLR1\n**Folate Receptor Alpha** emerged as the strongest candidate based on multiple converging pieces of evidence:\n\n**Literature Evidence:**\n- Multiple publications specifically linking FOLR1 to ovarian cancer\n- Studies showing FOLR1 expression in ovarian cancer cells\n- Research on FOLR1-directed therapeutics for ovarian cancer treatment\n\n**Functional Relevance:**\n- Cell surface receptor for folate\n- Critical role in cell proliferation and survival pathways\n- Well-established cancer target mechanism\n\n**Database Evidence:**\n- FOLR1 is among the most frequently cited genes in ovarian cancer GWAS studies\n- Folate receptor pathway consistently associated with cancer risk\n\n### Secondary Candidates\n**ARAP1** showed secondary evidence for ovarian cancer association:\n- Literature mentions ARAP1 as an independent prognostic biomarker in ovarian high-grade serous adenocarcinoma\n- Involved in vesicle trafficking and cellular processes relevant to malignancy\n\n**Other genes** with moderate cancer relevance included:\n- ANAPC15 (cell cycle regulation)\n- LAMTOR1 (mTOR signaling pathway)\n- RNF121 (protein ubiquitination)\n- NUMA1 (chromosome alignment and cell division)\n\n### Supporting Evidence\nThe remaining genes in the locus showed limited evidence for direct association with ovarian neoplasms, with functions primarily related to:\n- Developmental processes (MESE, PHOX2A)\n- Metabolic functions (CLPB, IDH2)\n- Immune responses (IL18BP, CIB1)\n- Structural/cytoskeletal functions (ARPIN, KIF7)\n\n## Biological Rationale\n\nFOLR1's identification as the likely causal gene is biologically plausible due to several factors:\n\n1. **Cancer Target Status**: Folate receptors are among the most extensively validated cancer targets, particularly for ovarian cancer where up to 75% of epithelial ovarian cancers express FOLR1.\n\n2. **Mechanistic Relevance**: FOLR1 facilitates cell proliferation through folate metabolism, a critical pathway for rapidly dividing cancer cells.\n\n3. **Therapeutic Relevance**: FOLR1 is the primary target for FDA-approved ovarian cancer therapies including farletuzumab, a monoclonal antibody specifically designed for FOLR1-positive cancers.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**FOLR1** is the most likely causal gene for ovarian neoplasms within this locus, supported by robust literature evidence, established biological mechanisms, and proven therapeutic relevance in ovarian cancer treatment.\n\n---\n\n*Analysis conducted using GWAS Catalog database, literature search results, and functional annotation of candidate genes.*",
