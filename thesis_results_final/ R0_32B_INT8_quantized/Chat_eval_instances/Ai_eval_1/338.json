This provides a direct mechanistic link to urate homeostasis through:\n- Uric acid reabsorption in the kidney proximal tubules\n- Regulation of serum uric acid concentration\n- Known drug targets for gout treatment ( GLUT9/URAT1 inhibitors)\n\n## Conclusion\n**SLC2A9** is identified as the most likely causal gene for urate levels in this locus based on:\n1. Overwhelming GWAS evidence (55 associations with extremely significant P-values)\n2. Direct biological mechanism as the uric acid transporter\n3. Consistent literature support across multiple independent studies\n4. Known clinical relevance as a therapeutic target for hyperuricemia and gout\n\nThe other candidate genes (DEFB131A, DRD5, WDR1) showed minimal or no evidence for direct involvement in uric acid metabolism, lacking the robust statistical and mechanistic support demonstrated by SLC2A9.",
