Strong literature evidence from PubMed studies\n2. Consistent GWAS associations across multiple studies\n3. Direct OMIM gene-disease relationship\n4. Biological plausibility through established protein function\n5. Replication in different populations\n\n---\n\n*Analysis based on systematic review of 12 genes in the locus using multiple biological databases and literature sources.*",
