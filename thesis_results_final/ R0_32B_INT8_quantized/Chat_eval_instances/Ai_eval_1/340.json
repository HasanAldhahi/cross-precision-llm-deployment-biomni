Multiple disease associations across cholesterol-related phenotypes\n2. Established biological mechanism in cholesterol homeostasis\n3. Clinical validation through therapeutic targeting\n\n## References\n\n[1] DisGeNET database analysis showing PCSK9 associations with 9 cholesterol-related disorders including familial hypercholesterolemia and LDL cholesterol measurement.\n\n[2] Biological function confirmed through established knowledge of PCSK9's role in regulating LDL receptor degradation and cholesterol homeostasis.\n\n[3] Clinical validation provided by FDA-approved PCSK9 inhibitor drugs used for cholesterol management, demonstrating direct therapeutic relevance.",
