GRB2**\n\nAmong the four options provided, GRB2 is the only gene with documented literature supporting its involvement in viral interaction mechanisms. Given that:\n1. P-HIPSter database was successfully used to identify MPXV-human protein interactions\n2. GRB2 has extensive literature on viral entry receptor functions\n3. The other genes lack evidence for viral interaction roles\n4. Host-range proteins typically interact with cellular signaling pathways\n\nGRB2 represents the most scientifically supported candidate for encoding a protein that interacts with the Monkeypox virus D10L host-range protein.\n\n---\n\n**References:**\n[1] Zhu et al. \"Novel drug targets for monkeypox: From viral to host proteins.\" *Infectious medicine* 2025 (PMID: 40026317) - Describes comprehensive MPXV-human PPI network using P-HIPSter database",
