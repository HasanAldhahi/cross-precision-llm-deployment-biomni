PRPF40A is directly involved in processing these retained mRNAs, making it the most relevant gene to perturb in this experimental context. 5. **Perturbation Effect**: Disrupting PRPF40A would create the strongest synthetic effect with selinexor treatment, likely affecting drug resistance mechanisms by disrupting nuclear export compensatory pathways. The other genes have much lower dependency values and are involved in different pathways that are less directly connected to selinexor's mechanism of action.

Multiple studies specifically demonstrate that: 1. KEAP1 regulates ferroptosis pathways directly targeted by sorafenib 2. The Nrf2-Keap1 pathway is specifically implicated in sorafenib resistance 3. Long noncoding RNAs and other proteins affect sorafenib resistance via the Nrf2-Keap1 pathway 4.

[✓] Prioritize variants based on association strength (p-values, effect sizes) 4. [✓] Return the top variant **Analysis Results:** - I searched through 622,784 GWAS records and found 3,161 testosterone-related studies - Among the 11 variants provided, **rs1047891** is the only variant that shows direct associations with testosterone-related traits - rs1047891 has 11 significant associations with: - Sex hormone-binding globulin levels (multiple studies with p-values ranging from 0.007 to 0.04) - Free androgen index (one study with p-value 0.0) - All other variants showed no direct testosterone-related associations The sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) is directly involved in testosterone transport and measurement, making rs1047891 highly relevant to testosterone levels. This variant consistently shows significant associations across multiple studies specifically related to testosterone metabolism and transport. <solution> rs1047891 </solution>",

The other genes either lack direct gastrointestinal associations or have weaker connections to the condition. <solution> SPINK1 </solution>",

The other variants (N414H and P1476L) were not found in ClinVar at all. However, I need to consider that \"Uncertain significance\" means the variant hasn't been definitively classified as benign or pathogenic. Since none of the variants clearly show up as benign in ClinVar, and two of them aren't found at all, the most conservative answer would be that there's insufficient information to determine which variant is benign. <solution>D</solution>",
