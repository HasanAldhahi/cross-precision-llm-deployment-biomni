Here's my reasoning: Patient phenotypes include: - Muscle weakness (HP:0001324) - Skeletal muscle atrophy (HP:0003202) - Atypical behavior (HP:0000708) - Alkalosis/Metabolic alkalosis (HP:0001948, HP:0200114) - Arrhythmia (HP:0011675) - Hypermetropia (HP:0000540) - Abnormality of hair texture (HP:0010719) - Tendonitis (HP:0025230) Candidate gene analysis: - **BSCL2 (ENSG00000168000)**: Associated with lipodystrophy, neuronopathy, spastic paraplegia, and encephalopathy. This explains the muscle weakness/atrophy (through neuronopathy and spastic paraplegia), atypical behavior (through encephalopathy), and alkalosis (through lipodystrophy-related metabolic disturbances). - **KCNH2 (ENSG00000055118)**: Associated with cardiac arrhythmias, which matches one phenotype but not the neuromuscular symptoms. - **HYDIN (ENSG00000157423)**: Associated with ciliary dyskinesia, which doesn't match the phenotype profile. - **MC4R (ENSG00000166603)**: Associated with obesity, which doesn't match the muscle weakness/atrophy phenotype. - **RSPO2 (ENSG00000147655)**: Associated with limb hypoplasia, which doesn't match the full phenotype profile. - **DLL3 (ENSG00000090932)**: Associated with spondylocostal dysostosis, which doesn't match the phenotype profile. BSCL2 explains the core neuromuscular and metabolic phenotypes, making it the most likely causal gene.</think> <solution> {'causal_gene': ['ENSG00000168000']} </solution>",
