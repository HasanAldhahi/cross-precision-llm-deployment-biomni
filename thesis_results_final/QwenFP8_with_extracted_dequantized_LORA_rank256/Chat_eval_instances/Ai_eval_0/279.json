Plasmid Transfection - traditional method, but may not be as efficient for primary cells b. Lentivirus/Retrovirus - viral methods, which can work but have different considerations c. RNP/mRNA electroporation - this matches what I found about ribonucleoprotein methods being efficient for myeloid cells d. RNP/mRNA microinjection - more invasive, typically used for embryos or oocytes e. mRNA LNP - lipid nanoparticles for mRNA delivery f. AAV - viral vector method Based on the literature, RNP/mRNA electroporation (option c) seems to be the most relevant method for primary macrophages, as it's specifically mentioned in research about efficient editing of primary human myeloid cells.</think> Based on my literature searches, I found several key studies indicating that RNP/mRNA electroporation is particularly effective for primary myeloid cells, including macrophages. The research shows that CRISPR-Cas9 ribonucleoproteins (RNP) are used efficiently for gene disruption in primary human myeloid cells, and electroporation methods have been optimized for non-viral gene editing in these cell types. <solution> c. RNP/mRNA electroporation </solution>",
