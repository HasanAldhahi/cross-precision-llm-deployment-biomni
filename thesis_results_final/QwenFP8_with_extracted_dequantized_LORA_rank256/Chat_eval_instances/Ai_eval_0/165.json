[✓] Loaded HPO data to translate phenotype codes to descriptions 2. [✓] Analyzed candidate genes in OMIM database for disease associations 3. [✓] Identified neurological phenotype patterns in the patient 4. [✓] Matched phenotypes to specific gene associations The patient presents with multiple neurological phenotypes including: - Spastic paraplegia (HP:0002493, HP:0001276) - Parkinsonism (HP:0001300) - Rigidity (HP:0002063) - Gait disturbance (HP:0001288) - Hyperreflexia (HP:0001347) - Acute neuropathic episodes (HP:0007256) Among the candidate genes, **ENSG00000169359** (Solute carrier family 33, member 1) is the only gene with direct associations to spastic paraplegia: - Spastic paraplegia 42, autosomal dominant - Huppke-Brendel syndrome This gene shows the strongest phenotypic concordance with the patient's clinical presentation, specifically matching the core diagnosis of spastic paraplegia and related neurological symptoms. <solution> {'causal_gene': ['ENSG00000169359']} </solution>",
