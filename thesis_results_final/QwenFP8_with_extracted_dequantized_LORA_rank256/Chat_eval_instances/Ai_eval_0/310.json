[✓] Search for information about candidate genes in breast cancer context 4. [✓] Search for BRCA1 knockdown experiments in MCF10A cells 5. [✓] Check individual gene functions and pathways From my searches, I found: - **PPP1R15B**: \"Protein phosphatase 1, regulatory subunit 15B is a survival factor for ERα-positive breast cancer\" - This suggests PPP1R15B is involved in breast cancer survival - **PLEC**: Found in a study about breast cancer response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy - **SPATA31A1**: Found in a study about human lifespan and copy number variation - **SSX3**: Found in a study about serum proteomic signatures of male breast cancer Since I couldn't find the specific gene set, I need to consider what's known about BRCA1 function. BRCA1 is a tumor suppressor involved in DNA repair and genomic stability. When knocked down, it leads to genomic instability and increased cell proliferation. Among the candidates, **PPP1R15B** appears most relevant to breast cancer survival and protein homeostasis, which could be affected by BRCA1 knockdown. The other genes have less direct connections to breast cancer progression. <solution> [ANSWER]A[/ANSWER] </solution>",

  "prompt": "The following is a multiple choice question about biology.\nPlease answer by responding with the letter of the correct answer.\n\nQuestion: Which of the following genes is most likely contained in the gene set BRCA1_DN.V1_DN, which contains genes down-regulated in MCF10A cells (breast cancer) upon knockdown of BRCA1 [GeneID=672] gene by RNAi. This gene set is a part of the C6 collection: oncogenic signature gene sets. \nOptions:\nA.PPP1R15B\nB.PLEC\nC.SPATA31A1\nD.Insufficient information to answer the question.\nE.SSX3\n\nYou MUST include the letter of the correct answer within the following tags:\n[ANSWER] and [/ANSWER]. For example, '[ANSWER]<answer>[/ANSWER]',\nwhere <answer> is the correct letter. Always answer in exactly this format\nof a single letter between the two tags, even if you are unsure.\nWe require this because we use automatic parsing.\n            ",
