Among the associated genes, IL18 (Interleukin 18) emerges as the most promising variant for further examination.\n\nThe evidence supporting IL18 as the top candidate includes:\n1. Direct prediction in P-HIPSTER database for interaction with Yaba-like disease virus 14L protein\n2. Strong biological relevance as an immune system cytokine\n3. Supporting literature showing \"A unique bivalent binding and inhibition mechanism by the yatapoxvirus interleukin 18 binding protein\" (PMID: 22927815)\n4. IL18 plays a crucial role in innate immunity and inflammatory responses, making it highly relevant to viral infection studies\n\nIL18 is therefore the most promising variant for further investigation into the host-virus interactions of Yaba-like disease virus.",
