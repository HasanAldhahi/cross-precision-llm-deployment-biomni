  "last_200_tokens": "- No specific literature found 2. [✓] Searched for ALDH3B2 gene function - Found literature showing ALDH3B2 has tryptophan residues important for localization 3. [✓] Checked GWAS catalog for associations with rs2769264 - Found association with high density lipoprotein cholesterol measurement 4. [✓] Verified ALDH3B2's connection to tryptophan metabolism through UniProt query **Key Evidence:** - The paper \"Mouse aldehyde dehydrogenase ALDH3B2 is localized to lipid droplets via two C-terminal tryptophan residues and lipid modification\" (PMID: 25286108) directly shows that ALDH3B2 contains tryptophan residues that are functionally important for its localization to lipid droplets - ALDH3B2 is an aldehyde dehydrogenase, which is involved in metabolic pathways that could affect tryptophan derivatives like N-acetyltryptophan - ACY3 (acyl-CoA synthetase 3) showed no literature connections to tryptophan metabolism in my searches The presence of tryptophan residues in ALDH3B2 that are critical for its function strongly suggests that variations in this gene could affect tryptophan metabolism pathways, potentially impacting N-acetyltryptophan metabolite levels. <solution> Based on the literature evidence showing that ALDH3B2 contains tryptophan residues critical for its localization to lipid droplets and its role as an aldehyde dehydrogenase in metabolic pathways, ALDH3B2 is the likely causal gene for N-acetyltryptophan metabolite levels in this locus. </solution>",
