I searched for each candidate gene in OMIM data and found their associated phenotypes 3. The patient has multiple phenotypes, but the most prominent and consistent ones are: - Global developmental delay (HP:0001263) - Intellectual disability, severe (HP:0010864) - Seizure (HP:0001250) 4. Among the candidate genes, only GOT2 (ENSG00000125166) is specifically associated with \"Developmental and epileptic encephalopathy 82\" in OMIM, which directly matches the patient's core phenotypes of developmental delay, intellectual disability, and seizures. 5. The other genes are associated with different conditions: - FOXC2: Lymphedema-distichiasis syndrome - RASA1: Capillary malformation-arteriovenous malformation syndrome - CD3D: Immunodeficiency 19, severe combined - GLE1: Lethal congenital contracture syndrome 1 - ALPL: Odontohypophosphatasia - MPZ: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, type 2I - SOX9: Campomelic dysplasia with autosomal sex reversal - SCNN1B: Bronchiectasis with or without elevated sweat sodium - LRRC56: Ciliary dyskinesia, primary, 39 The patient's phenotypes strongly point to GOT2 as the causal gene, as it is specifically associated with developmental and epileptic encephalopathy, which matches the patient's presentation of global developmental delay, severe intellectual disability, and seizures.</think> <solution> {'causal_gene': ['ENSG00000125166']} </solution>",
