Here's my reasoning: 1. **HPO Term Analysis**: The patient's phenotypes include multiple HPO terms that appear to be related to hearing impairment and sensorineural hearing loss. 2. **Gene-Phenotype Associations**: From the DisGeNET dataset, I found that GJB3 is strongly associated with: - Deafness, Acquired - DEAFNESS, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE - Hearing Loss, Extreme - Hearing Loss, High-Frequency - Bilateral Deafness - Complete Hearing Loss - Congenital sensorineural hearing loss - hearing impairment - Nonsyndromic Deafness - Prelingual Deafness - Progressive sensorineural hearing impairment - Sensorineural Hearing Loss 3. **Biological Function**: GJB3 encodes connexin 3, a gap junction protein that is critical for hearing function. Gap junctions are essential for the proper functioning of the cochlea and auditory system. 4. **Comparison with Other Candidates**: While other genes like KCNQ1 (cardiac disorders), TBP (developmental disorders), and OCRL (metabolic disorders) have many phenotype associations, they don't show the same specific pattern of hearing-related phenotypes that GJB3 does. 5. **Pattern Matching**: The patient's phenotype set appears to have a significant focus on hearing-related issues, which matches perfectly with GJB3's known associations. Therefore, GJB3 (ENSG00000188910) is the most likely causal gene given the phenotype pattern.</think> <solution> {'causal_gene': ['ENSG00000188910']} </solution>",
