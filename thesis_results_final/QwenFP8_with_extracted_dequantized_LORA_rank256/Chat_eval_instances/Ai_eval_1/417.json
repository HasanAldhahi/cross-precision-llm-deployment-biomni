Its variants confer measurable protective effects against oxidative DNA damage from radiation and determine skin pigmentation traits that are strongly associated with skin cancer risk (fair skin and red hair). MC1R is therefore the most likely causal gene for the GWAS phenotype related to skin cancer and photoprotection.",
