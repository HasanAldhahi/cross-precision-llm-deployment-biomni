This gene is primarily involved in B-cell signaling and immune responses.\n\n2. **MANBA**: No literature found connecting MANBA to central nucleus volume or brain anatomy. MANBA encodes beta-mannosidase, involved in lysosomal function.\n\n3. **NFKB1**: Found literature showing NFKB1 is involved in neuroinflammation and brain ischemia responses, but no direct connection to central nucleus volume measurements.\n\n4. **SLC39A8**: Found multiple studies connecting SLC39A8 to brain anatomy and regional brain volumes:\n   - Studies exploring genetic correlations between obesity-related traits and regional brain volumes\n   - Research on zinc/manganese transporters in brain barrier tissues and central nervous system\n   - Evidence showing SLC39A8 plays a role in brain volume regulation\n\n**Conclusion:**\nSLC39A8 has the strongest evidence supporting its involvement in central nucleus volume regulation. This gene encodes a zinc transporter that is expressed in brain barrier tissues and has been directly implicated in brain volume studies, making it the most likely causal gene for central nucleus volume among the given options.",
