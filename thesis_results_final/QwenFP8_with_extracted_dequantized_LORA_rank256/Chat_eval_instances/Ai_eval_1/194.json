Let me verify this with a simpler search and then conclude.</think> Based on my literature search results, I can clearly see that BTK is directly associated with B-cell lymphoma: **Evidence Summary:** 1. **PubMed Literature**: Multiple papers specifically mention Bruton Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) inhibitors being used for B-cell lymphomas: - \"Experience of Using a Bruton Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) Inhibitor in Primary Testicular Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) with Isolated Central Nervous System (CNS) Metastasis\" - Papers about Richter Transformation and other B-cell lymphoma subtypes 2. **Gene Function**: BTK encodes Bruton's tyrosine kinase, which is critical for B-cell development and function. Mutations in BTK cause X-linked agammaglobulinemia, which affects B-cell function. 3. **Clinical Relevance**: BTK inhibitors are established therapeutic agents for various B-cell lymphomas, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and Waldenström macroglobulinemia. The other genes in the locus (ARL13A, ARMCX1, ARMCX2, ARMCX3, ARMCX4, ARMCX6, CENPI, DRP2, GLA, HNRNPH2, NOX1, RPL36A, TAF7L, TIMM8A, TMEM35A, TRMT2B, XKRX) do not have direct associations with B-cell lymphoma in the literature or databases I've searched. <solution> {'causal_gene': ['BTK']} </solution>",
