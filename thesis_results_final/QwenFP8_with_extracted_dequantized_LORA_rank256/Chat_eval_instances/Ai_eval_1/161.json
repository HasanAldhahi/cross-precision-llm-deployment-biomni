[✓] Converted Ensembl gene IDs to gene symbols (completed) 3. [✓] Queried OMIM database for gene-phenotype associations (completed) 4. [✓] Analyzed matches between phenotypes and genes (completed) 5. [✓] Identified the most likely causal gene (completed) The patient presents with a clear cluster of gastrointestinal phenotypes related to fat malabsorption: - Steatorrhea (HP:0002570) - Fat malabsorption (HP:0002630) - Hypocholesterolemia (HP:0003146) - Diarrhea (HP:0002014) - Vomiting (HP:0002013) - Abdominal distention (HP:0003270) - Failure to thrive (HP:0001508) - Growth delay (HP:0001510) Among the candidate genes, **SAR1B (ENSG00000152700)** is the only gene associated with a disease that matches this phenotype cluster. SAR1B causes **chylomicron retention disease**, which is characterized by exactly these symptoms: fat malabsorption, steatorrhea, hypocholesterolemia, and associated growth/failure to thrive issues due to nutritional deficiencies. The other genes are associated with different conditions that don't match the primary phenotype cluster: - SMN1: Spinal muscular atrophy (muscle issues) - PMPCA: Spinocerebellar ataxia (neurological issues) - ATP6V0A2: Wrinkly skin syndrome (skin issues) - SPATA7: Leber congenital amaurosis (eye issues) - COL4A1: Retinal arteries tortuosity (eye/vessel issues) <solution> {'causal_gene': ['ENSG00000152700']} </solution>",
