  "last_200_tokens": "protocols are frequently mentioned in the context of CRISPR-Cas9 delivery for mammalian cells 3. The \"High-Throughput DNA Plasmid Transfection Using Acoustic Droplet Ejection Technology\" paper specifically mentions plasmid transfection for mammalian cells 4. The \"Protocol for fast antibiotic resistance-based gene editing of mammalian cells with CRISPR-Cas9\" was mentioned multiple times HeLa cells are adherent and easily transfected, making them well-suited for plasmid transfection. Let me think about the different delivery methods: - **Plasmid Transfection (a)**: Standard method for cell lines like HeLa, which are easily transfected with DNA plasmids - **Lentivirus/Retrovirus (b)**: More complex, used for stable integration - **RNP/mRNA electroporation (c)**: Good for primary cells but can be harsh on established cell lines - **RNP/mRNA microinjection (d)**: Typically used for embryos or single cells, not practical for cell line work - **mRNA LNP (e)**: More commonly used for in vivo delivery - **AAV (f)**: Good for stable expression but more commonly used for in vivo applications Given that HeLa cells are a well-established cell line that is easily transfected, and considering the search results showing plasmid transfection protocols being used for CRISPR in mammalian cells, plasmid transfection appears to be the most relevant method. <solution> a. Plasmid Transfection </solution>",
