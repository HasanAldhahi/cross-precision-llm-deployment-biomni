Studies show PAM deficiency causes sarcopenic diabetes mellitus 4. PAM is involved in beta-cell function and insulin secretion mechanisms Let me update my plan and provide the final analysis: 1. [✓] Search literature for Type 2 diabetes associations with each gene (completed) 2. [✓] Query GWAS catalog for associations between these genes and Type 2 diabetes (completed) 3. [✓] Check gene function and biological relevance to diabetes (completed) 4. [✓] Analyze expression patterns in relevant tissues (completed) 5. [✓] Determine the most likely causal gene based on evidence (completed) <solution> Based on comprehensive literature analysis and biological evidence, PAM (Peptidylglycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase) is the most likely causal gene for Type 2 diabetes in this locus. The evidence includes: 1. Multiple direct associations with Type 2 diabetes risk alleles 2. Influence on GLP-1 levels and response to GLP-1 receptor agonists 3. Role in beta-cell function and insulin secretion 4. Deficiency of PAM causes sarcopenic diabetes mellitus 5. Identified as a potential therapeutic target for Type 2 diabetes The literature consistently shows PAM's involvement in diabetes-related pathways, making it the strongest candidate among the genes listed. <solution></solution>",
