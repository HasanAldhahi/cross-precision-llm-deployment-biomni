The patient has multiple phenotypes represented by HPO codes 2. From the OMIM database, I found that among the candidate genes: - BMP4 (ENSG00000125378) is associated with Orofacial cleft 11 and Microphthalmia - CNGB3 (ENSG00000170289) is associated with Achromatopsia 3 - Other genes are associated with various non-eye phenotypes like cancer, obesity, spastic paraplegia, etc. 3. From the HPO code searches, I observed that most of the HPO codes are related to eye phenotypes (cataracts, microphthalmia, orofacial clefts, etc.) 4. BMP4 is specifically associated with: - Orofacial cleft 11 (eye/face development) - Microphthalmia (small eye phenotype) 5. CNGB3 is associated with Achromatopsia 3 (severe visual impairment) 6. The pattern of HPO codes suggests multiple eye-related phenotypes, and BMP4 is the gene that matches the most comprehensive pattern of eye-related phenotypes (orofacial cleft and microphthalmia) that could lead to the various eye conditions represented by the HPO codes. Therefore, the causal gene is most likely BMP4 (ENSG00000125378).</think> <solution> { \"causal_gene\": [\"ENSG00000125378\"] } </solution>",
