From the OMIM data, I can see that Freeman-Sheldon syndrome has MIM number 193700. Let me update my plan and provide the solution.</think> I need to update my plan and provide the final diagnosis based on the evidence I've gathered: 1. [✓] Convert Ensembl gene ID to gene symbol (Found: MYH3) 2. [✓] Look up HPO phenotype codes to understand clinical features 3. [✓] Query OMIM database for diseases associated with the gene and phenotypes 4. [✓] Match phenotypes with known diseases to make a diagnosis Based on my analysis: - The candidate gene ENSG00000109063 corresponds to MYH3 - The patient's phenotypes include contractures, camptodactyly, hearing impairment, cryptorchidism, scoliosis, and facial features - The OMIM data shows that MYH3 is associated with Freeman-Sheldon syndrome (MIM 193700) and Sheldon-Hall syndrome - The combination of phenotypes (contractures, camptodactyly, hearing impairment, cryptorchidism, scoliosis, narrow mouth, long philtrum, delayed speech) is most consistent with Freeman-Sheldon syndrome <solution> { \"disease_name\": \"Freeman-Sheldon syndrome\", \"OMIM_ID\": \"193700\" } </solution>",
