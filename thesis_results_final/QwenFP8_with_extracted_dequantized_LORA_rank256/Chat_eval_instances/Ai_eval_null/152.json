Based on the previous analysis, I found that IL4R (Interleukin-4 receptor) is the most biologically plausible candidate gene for T-cell lymphoma, as it's directly involved in T-cell regulation and immune responses, and showed the strongest connection to the disease. The other candidates like HAVCR2, HLA-DPB1, IL18RAP, and HLA-DRB1 showed weaker or no connections to T-cell lymphoma. IL4R is the most likely causal gene given its role in T-cell regulation and the literature evidence I found. Let me format the final answer properly.</think> <solution> {'causal_gene': ['IL4R']} </solution>",
