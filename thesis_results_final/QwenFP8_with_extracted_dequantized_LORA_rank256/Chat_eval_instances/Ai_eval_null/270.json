The OMIM ID for this syndrome is 611549, which is the format required for the output.</think> I have successfully diagnosed the patient's rare disease by analyzing the phenotypes and candidate gene. The patient's phenotypes include congenital contractures, developmental delays, respiratory insufficiency, and characteristic facial features, which match the syndrome associated with the NALCN gene. **Plan Update:** 1. [✓] Look up the phenotypes (HP codes) to understand the clinical features 2. [✓] Convert the Ensembl gene ID to a gene symbol (NALCN) 3. [✓] Query databases to find diseases associated with these phenotypes and gene 4. [✓] Identify the most likely rare disease diagnosis (CLIFAHDD syndrome) 5. [✓] Format the output as required The diagnosis is based on the perfect match between the patient's phenotypes and the known syndrome associated with NALCN gene variants. The OMIM database confirms this syndrome has ID 611549. <solution> {'disease_name': 'Congenital contractures of the limbs and face, hypotonia, and developmental delay', 'OMIM_ID': 611549} </solution>",
