Although the noise is on average $611\times $ stronger than the signal (dashed blue line) and peaks at $4348\times $ in Layer 2, the model retains functionality, consistent with geometric (near-)orthogonality.}}{35}{figure.5.1}%

INT4 noise (yellow) exhibits near-zero similarity to the LoRA adapter, comparable to a random baseline (grey). FP8 and INT4 errors (blue) also show low mutual correlation, suggesting that different quantization methods induce distinct error landscapes.}}{36}{figure.5.2}%
