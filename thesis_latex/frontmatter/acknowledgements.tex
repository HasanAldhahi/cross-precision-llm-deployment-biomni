I thank my supervisors, Prof.\ Julian Kunkel and Dr.\ Narges Lux, for their help and support during this work. Their comments and advice influenced the design of the study and the presentation of the results, especially in the areas of systems optimization and machine learning. I also thank the open source community for the tools used in this project. I am grateful to the teams behind vLLM, MergeKit, \texttt{llm-compressor}, and the Transformers library for the software that this work depends on.
The open-source community's commitment to transparency and reproducibility continues to advance the field of machine learning.

Special thanks to the creators of the Qwen and Biomni models for making their work publicly available, enabling research on quantization and domain adaptation.

Finally, I would like to thank my family and friends for their unwavering support and encouragement during the course of this Master's program.
